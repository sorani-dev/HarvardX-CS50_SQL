INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1,'To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2,'I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3,'In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4,'It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5,'All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(6,'He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(7,'He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(8,'They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(9,'But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(10,'Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(11,'And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(12,'I had seen little of Holmes lately.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(13,'My marriage had drifted us away from each other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(14,'My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(15,'He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(16,'From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(17,'Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(18,'One night—it was on the 20th of March, 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(19,'As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(20,'His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(21,'He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(22,'To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(23,'He was at work again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(24,'He had arisen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(25,'I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(26,'His manner was not effusive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(27,'It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(28,'With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(29,'Then he stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(30,'Wedlock suits you, he remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(31,'I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(32,'Seven! I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(33,'Indeed, I should have thought a little more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(34,'Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(35,'And in practice again, I observe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(36,'You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(37,'Then, how do you know?  I see it, I deduce it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(38,'How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?  My dear Holmes, said I, this is too much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(39,'You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(40,'It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I have changed my clothes, I can’t imagine how you deduce it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(41,'As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(42,'He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(43,'It is simplicity itself, said he; my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(44,'Obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(45,'Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(46,'As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(47,'I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(48,'When I hear you give your reasons, I remarked, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(49,'And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(50,'Quite so, he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an arm-chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(51,'You see, but you do not observe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(52,'The distinction is clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(53,'For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.  Frequently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(54,'How often?  Well, some hundreds of times.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(55,'Then how many are there?  How many? I don’t know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(56,'Quite so! You have not observed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(57,'And yet you have seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(58,'That is just my point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(59,'Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(60,'By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(61,'He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(62,'It came by the last post, said he. Read it aloud.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(63,'The note was undated, and without either signature or address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(64,'There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock, it said, a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(65,'Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(66,'This account of you we have from all quarters received.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(67,'Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(68,'This is indeed a mystery, I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(69,'What do you imagine that it means?  I have no data yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(70,'It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(71,'Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(72,'What do you deduce from it?  I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(73,'The man who wrote it was presumably well to do, I remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion’s processes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(74,'Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(75,'It is peculiarly strong and stiff.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(76,'Peculiar—that is the very word, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(77,'It is not an English paper at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(78,'Hold it up to the light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(79,'I did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_ with a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(80,'What do you make of that? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(81,'The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.  Not at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(82,'The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(83,'’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(84,'’ _P_, of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the _Eg_.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(85,'Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(86,'He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(87,'Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(88,'It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(89,'‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(90,'’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that? His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(91,'The paper was made in Bohemia, I said.  Precisely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(92,'And the man who wrote the note is a German.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(93,'Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(94,'’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(95,'It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(96,'It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(97,'And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(98,'As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(99,'A pair, by the sound, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(100,'Yes, he continued, glancing out of the window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(101,'A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(102,'A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(103,'There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(104,'I think that I had better go, Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(105,'Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(106,'I am lost without my Boswell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(107,'And this promises to be interesting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(108,'It would be a pity to miss it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(109,'But your client—  Never mind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(110,'I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(111,'Sit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(112,'A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(113,'Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(114,'Come in! said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(115,'[Illustration: A MAN ENTERED]  A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(116,'His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(117,'Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(118,'Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(119,'He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(120,'From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(121,'You had my note? he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(122,'I told you that I would call.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(123,'He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(124,'Pray take a seat, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(125,'This is my friend and colleague, Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(126,'Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(127,'Whom have I the honor to address?  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(128,'I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(129,'If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(130,'I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(131,'It is both, or none, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(132,'You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(133,'The count shrugged his broad shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(134,'Then I must begin, said he, by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(135,'At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(136,'I promise, said Holmes.  And I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(137,'You will excuse this mask, continued our strange visitor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(138,'The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(139,'I was aware of it, said Holmes, dryly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(140,'The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(141,'To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(142,'I was also aware of that, murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his arm-chair and closing his eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(143,'Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(144,'Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(145,'If your Majesty would condescend to state your case, he remarked, I should be better able to advise you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(146,'The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(147,'Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(148,'You are right, he cried; I am the King.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(149,'Why should I attempt to conceal it?  Why, indeed? murmured Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(150,'Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(151,'But you can understand, said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(152,'Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(153,'I have come _incognito_ from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(154,'Then, pray consult, said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(155,'The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(156,'The name is no doubt familiar to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(157,'Kindly look her up in my index, doctor, murmured Holmes, without opening his eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(158,'For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(159,'In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(160,'Let me see! said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(161,'Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(162,'Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—Yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.  Precisely so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(163,'But how—  Was there a secret marriage?  None.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(164,'No legal papers or certificates?  None.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(165,'Then I fail to follow your Majesty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(166,'If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?  There is the writing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(167,'Pooh, pooh! Forgery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(168,'My private note-paper.  Stolen.  My own seal.  Imitated.  My photograph.  Bought.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(169,'We were both in the photograph.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(170,'Oh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.  I was mad—insane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(171,'You have compromised yourself seriously.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(172,'I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(173,'It must be recovered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(174,'We have tried and failed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(175,'Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(176,'She will not sell.  Stolen, then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(177,'Five attempts have been made.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(178,'Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(179,'Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(180,'Twice she has been waylaid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(181,'There has been no result.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(182,'No sign of it?  Absolutely none.  Holmes laughed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(183,'It is quite a pretty little problem, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(184,'But a very serious one to me, returned the King, reproachfully.  Very, indeed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(185,'And what does she propose to do with the photograph?  To ruin me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(186,'But how?  I am about to be married.  So I have heard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(187,'To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(188,'You may know the strict principles of her family.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(189,'She is herself the very soul of delicacy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(190,'A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(191,'And Irene Adler?  Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(192,'I know that she will do it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(193,'You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(194,'She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(195,'Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(196,'You are sure that she has not sent it yet?  I am sure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(197,'And why?  Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(198,'That will be next Monday.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(199,'Oh, then, we have three days yet, said Holmes, with a yawn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(200,'That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(201,'Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?  Certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(202,'You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the Count Von Kramm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(203,'Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.  Pray do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(204,'I shall be all anxiety.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(205,'Then, as to money?  You have _carte blanche_.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(206,'Absolutely?  I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(207,'And for present expenses?  The king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(208,'There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(209,'Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(210,'And mademoiselle’s address? he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(211,'Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(212,'Holmes took a note of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(213,'One other question, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(214,'Was the photograph a cabinet?  It was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(215,'Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(216,'And good-night, Watson, he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(217,'If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o’clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(218,'II  At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(219,'The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(220,'I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(221,'I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(222,'Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(223,'So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(224,'It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(225,'Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(226,'With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(227,'Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed heartily for some minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(228,'Well, really! he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(229,'What is it?  It’s quite too funny.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(230,'I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.  I can’t imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(231,'I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(232,'Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(233,'I will tell you, however.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(234,'I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning, in the character of a groom out of work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(235,'There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(236,'Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(237,'I soon found Briony Lodge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(238,'It is a _bijou_ villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(239,'Chubb lock to the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(240,'Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(241,'Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(242,'I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(243,'I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(244,'I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(245,'And what of Irene Adler? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(246,'Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(247,'She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(248,'So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(249,'She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(250,'Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(251,'Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(252,'He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(254,'See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(255,'They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(256,'When I had listened to all that they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(257,'This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(258,'That sounded ominous.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(259,'What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(260,'If the latter, it was less likely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(261,'On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(262,'It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(263,'I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(264,'I am following you closely, I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(265,'I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(266,'He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(267,'He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(268,'He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(269,'Of her I could see nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(270,'Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(271,'As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(272,'‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(273,'Monica in the Edgware Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(274,'Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’  Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(275,'It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(276,'I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.  ‘The Church of St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(277,'Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(278,'’  This was quite too good to lose, Watson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(279,'I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau, when a cab came through the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(280,'The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(281,'Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(282,'’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(283,'My cabby drove fast.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(284,'I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(285,'The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(286,'I paid the man and hurried into the church.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(287,'There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(288,'They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(289,'I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(290,'Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(291,'Thank God! he cried. You’ll do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(292,'Come! Come!  What then? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(293,'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(294,'I was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(295,'It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(296,'It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(297,'It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(298,'The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(299,'This is a very unexpected turn of affairs, said I; and what then?  Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(300,'It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(301,'At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(302,'‘I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said, as she left him. I heard no more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(303,'They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(304,'Which are?  Some cold beef and a glass of beer, he answered, ringing the bell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(305,'I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(306,'By the way, doctor, I shall want your co-operation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(307,'I shall be delighted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(308,'You don’t mind breaking the law?  Not in the least.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(309,'Nor running a chance of arrest?  Not in a good cause.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(310,'Oh, the cause is excellent!  Then I am your man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(311,'I was sure that I might rely on you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(312,'But what is it you wish?  When Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(313,'Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(314,'Now, he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(315,'It is nearly five now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(316,'In two hours we must be on the scene of action.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(317,'Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(318,'We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(319,'And what then?  You must leave that to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(320,'I have already arranged what is to occur.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(321,'There is only one point on which I must insist.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(322,'You must not interfere, come what may.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(323,'You understand?  I am to be neutral?  To do nothing whatever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(324,'There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(325,'It will end in my being conveyed into the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(326,'Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(327,'You are to station yourself close to that open window.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(328,'You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(329,'And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(330,'You quite follow me?  Entirely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(331,'It is nothing very formidable, he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(332,'It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(333,'Your task is confined to that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(334,'When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(335,'You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(336,'I hope that I have made myself clear?  I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.  Precisely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(337,'Then you may entirely rely on me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(338,'That is excellent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(339,'I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(340,'He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(341,'His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(342,'John Hare alone could have equalled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(343,'It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(344,'His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(345,'The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(346,'It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(347,'It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(348,'The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’s succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private that I expected.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(349,'On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(350,'There was a group of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(351,'You see, remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, this marriage rather simplifies matters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(352,'The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(353,'The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(354,'Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(355,'Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?  Where, indeed?  It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(356,'Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(357,'She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(358,'Two attempts of the sort have already been made.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(359,'We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(360,'Where, then?  Her banker or her lawyer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(361,'There is that double possibility.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(362,'But I am inclined to think neither.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(363,'Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(364,'Why should she hand it over to any one else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(365,'Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(366,'It must be where she can lay her hands upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(367,'It must be in her own house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(368,'But it has twice been burgled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(369,'Pshaw! They did not know how to look.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(370,'But how will you look?  I will not look.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(371,'What then?  I will get her to show me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(372,'But she will refuse.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(373,'She will not be able to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(374,'But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(375,'Now carry out my orders to the letter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(376,'As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(377,'It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(378,'As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(379,'A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(380,'A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(381,'Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(382,'At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(383,'Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(384,'Is the poor gentleman much hurt? she asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(385,'He is dead, cried several voices.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(386,'No, no, there’s life in him! shouted another.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(387,'But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(388,'He’s a brave fellow, said a woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(389,'They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(390,'They were a gang, and a rough one, too.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(391,'Ah, he’s breathing now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(392,'He can’t lie in the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(393,'May we bring him in, marm?  Surely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(394,'Bring him into the sitting-room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(395,'There is a comfortable sofa.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(396,'This way, please!  Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(397,'The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(398,'I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(399,'And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(400,'I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(401,'After all, I thought, we are not injuring her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(402,'We are but preventing her from injuring another.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(403,'Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(404,'A maid rushed across and threw open the window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(405,'At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of Fire! The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of Fire! Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(406,'I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(407,'Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(408,'He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(409,'You did it very nicely, doctor, he remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(410,'Nothing could have been better. It is all right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(411,'You have the photograph?  I know where it is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(412,'And how did you find out?  She showed me, as I told you that she would.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(413,'I am still in the dark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(414,'I do not wish to make a mystery, said he, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(415,'The matter was perfectly simple.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(416,'You, of course, saw that every one in the street was an accomplice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(417,'They were all engaged for the evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(418,'I guessed as much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(419,'Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(420,'I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(421,'That also I could fathom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(422,'Then they carried me in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(423,'She was bound to have me in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(424,'What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(425,'It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(426,'They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(427,'How did that help you?  It was all-important.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(428,'When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(429,'It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(430,'In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(431,'A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(432,'Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(433,'She would rush to secure it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(434,'The alarm of fire was admirably done.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(435,'The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(436,'She responded beautifully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(437,'The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(438,'She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(439,'When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(440,'I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(441,'I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(442,'A little over-precipitance may ruin all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(443,'And now? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(444,'Our quest is practically finished.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(445,'I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(446,'We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(447,'It might be a satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(448,'And when will you call?  At eight in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(449,'She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(450,'Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(451,'I must wire to the King without delay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(452,'We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(453,'He was searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:  Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(454,'There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(455,'I’ve heard that voice before, said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(456,'Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(457,'III  I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(458,'You have really got it! he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.  Not yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(459,'But you have hopes?  I have hopes.  Then, come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(460,'I am all impatience to be gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(461,'We must have a cab.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(462,'No, my brougham is waiting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(463,'Then that will simplify matters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(464,'We descended, and started off once more for Briony Lodge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(465,'Irene Adler is married, remarked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(466,'Married! When?  Yesterday.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(467,'But to whom?  To an English lawyer named Norton.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(468,'But she could not love him?  I am in hopes that she does.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(469,'And why in hopes?  Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(470,'If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(471,'If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty’s plan.  It is true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(472,'And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made! He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(473,'The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(474,'She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(475,'Sherlock Holmes, I believe? said she.  I am Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(476,'Holmes, answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(477,'Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(478,'She left this morning with her husband by the 5.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(479,'15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(480,'What! Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(481,'Do you mean that she has left England?  Never to return.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(482,'And the papers? asked the King, hoarsely. All is lost.  We shall see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(483,'He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(484,'The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(485,'Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(486,'The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to Sherlock Holmes, Esq.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(487,'To be left till called for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(488,'My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(489,'It was dated at midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:    MY DEAR MR.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(490,'SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very   well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(491,'You took me in completely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(492,'Until after the alarm of   fire, I had not a suspicion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(493,'But then, when I found how I had   betrayed myself, I began to think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(494,'I had been warned against   you months ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(495,'I had been told that, if the King employed an   agent, it would certainly be you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(496,'And your address had been   given me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(497,'Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you   wanted to know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(498,'Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard   to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(499,'But, you   know, I have been trained as an actress myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(500,'Male costume   is nothing new to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(501,'I often take advantage of the freedom   which it gives.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(502,'I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran   up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and   came down just as you departed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(503,'Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was   really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock   Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(504,'Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and   started for the Temple to see my husband.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(505,'We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by   so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty   when you call to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(506,'As to the photograph, your client may   rest in peace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(507,'I love and am loved by a better man than he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(508,'The King may do what he will without hinderance from one whom   he has cruelly wronged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(509,'I keep it only to safeguard myself,   and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any   steps which he might take in the future.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(510,'I leave a photograph   which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr.');

From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty, said Holmes, coldly.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(545,'You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(546,'Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me, I observed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(547,'You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(548,'A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(549,'You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(552,'As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(553,'Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(554,'I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(555,'Watson has not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(556,'As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(561,'Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(566,'Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(567,'Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(573,'You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(574,'Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?  I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(575,'Ah, of course, I forgot that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(576,'But the writing?  What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(577,'Well, but China?  The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(578,'I have made a small study of tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(579,'That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(580,'When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(581,'Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(582,'Well, I never! said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(583,'I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(584,'I begin to think, Watson, said Holmes, that I make a mistake in explaining.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(586,'Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(587,'Wilson?  Yes, I have got it now, he answered, with his thick, red finger planted half-way down the column. Here it is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(588,'This is what began it all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(589,'You just read it for yourself, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(590,'I took the paper from him, and read as follows:    TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the   late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(594,'What on earth does this mean? I ejaculated, after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(595,'Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(596,'It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it? said he. And now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(597,'Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(598,'You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(599,'It is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.  Very good. Now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(600,'Wilson?  Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(601,'Sherlock Holmes, said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; I have a small pawnbroker’s business at Coburg Square, near the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(602,'It’s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(603,'I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to learn the business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(604,'What is the name of this obliging youth? asked Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(605,'His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(606,'It’s hard to say his age.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(607,'I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(608,'Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what I am able to give him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(609,'But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?  Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(610,'It is not a common experience among employers in this age.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(611,'I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(612,'Oh, he has his faults, too, said Mr. Wilson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(613,'Never was such a fellow for photography.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(614,'Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develope his pictures.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(615,'That is his main fault; but, on the whole, he’s a good worker.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(616,'There’s no vice in him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(617,'He is still with you, I presume?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(618,'He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking, and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower, and never had any family.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(619,'We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(620,'The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(621,'Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  ‘I wish to the Lord, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(622,'Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(623,'’  ‘Why that?’ I asks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(624,'‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(625,'It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(626,'If my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(627,'’  ‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(628,'Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(629,'In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(630,'‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked, with his eyes open.  ‘Never.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(631,'’  ‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(632,'’  ‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(633,'‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(634,'’  Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(635,'‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(636,'‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(637,'As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(638,'He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(639,'From all I hear it is splendid pay, and very little to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(640,'’  ‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(641,'’  ‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(642,'‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(643,'This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(644,'Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(645,'Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(646,'Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(647,'’  Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(648,'Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(649,'He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(650,'I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(651,'From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(652,'Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(653,'I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(654,'Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(655,'When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(656,'How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(657,'There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(658,'Your experience has been a most entertaining one, remarked Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(659,'Pray continue your very interesting statement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(660,'There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even redder than mine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(661,'He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(662,'Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(663,'However, when our turn came, the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.  ‘This is Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(664,'Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(665,'’  ‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(666,'‘He has every requirement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(667,'I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(668,'’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(669,'Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(670,'‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(671,'‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(672,'’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(673,'‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(674,'‘I perceive that all is as it should be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(675,'But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(676,'I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(677,'’ He stepped over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(678,'A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(679,'‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(680,'Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(681,'Are you a married man, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(682,'Wilson? Have you a family?’  I answered that I had not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(683,'His face fell immediately.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(684,'‘Dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(685,'The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(686,'It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(687,'’  My face lengthened at this, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(688,'Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(689,'‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(690,'When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’  ‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(691,'‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(692,'Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(693,'‘I shall be able to look after that for you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(694,'’  ‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.  ‘Ten to two.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(695,'’  Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(696,'Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(697,'Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(698,'‘That would suit me very well,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(699,'‘And the pay?’  ‘Is £4 a week.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(700,'’  ‘And the work?’  ‘Is purely nominal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(701,'’  ‘What do you call purely nominal?’  ‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(702,'If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(703,'The will is very clear upon that point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(704,'You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(705,'’  ‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(706,'‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(707,'Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(708,'There you must stay, or you lose your billet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(709,'’  ‘And the work?’  ‘Is to copy out the Encyclopædia Britannica.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(710,'There is the first volume of it in that press.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(711,'You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(712,'Will you be ready to-morrow?’  ‘Certainly,’ I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(713,'‘Then, good-bye, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(714,'Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(715,'’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(716,'Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(717,'It seemed altogether past belief that any one could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(718,'’ Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(719,'However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(720,'Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(721,'The table was set out ready for me, and Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(722,'Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(723,'He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(724,'At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(725,'This went on day after day, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(726,'Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(727,'It was the same next week, and the same the week after.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(728,'Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(729,'Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(730,'Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(731,'Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(732,'It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(733,'And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(734,'To an end?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(735,'And no later than this morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(736,'I went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(737,'Here it is, and you can read for yourself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(738,'He held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of note-paper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(739,'It read in this fashion:    THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE    IS    DISSOLVED.    _October 9, 1890.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(740,'_  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(741,'I cannot see that there is anything very funny, cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(742,'If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(743,'No, no, cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(744,'I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(745,'It is most refreshingly unusual.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(746,'But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(747,'Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?  I was staggered, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(748,'I did not know what to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(749,'Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(750,'Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(751,'He said that he had never heard of any such body.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(752,'Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(753,'He answered that the name was new to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(754,'[Illustration: THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED]  ‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(755,'’  ‘What, the red-headed man?’  ‘Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(756,'’  ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(757,'He was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(758,'He moved out yesterday.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(759,'’  ‘Where could I find him?’  ‘Oh, at his new offices.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(760,'He did tell me the address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(761,'Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(762,'’  I started off, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(763,'Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(764,'William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(765,'And what did you do then? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(766,'I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(767,'But he could not help me in any way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(768,'He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(769,'But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(770,'I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(771,'And you did very wisely, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(772,'Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(773,'From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(774,'Grave enough! said Mr. Jabez Wilson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(775,'Why, I have lost four pound a week.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(776,'As far as you are personally concerned, remarked Holmes, I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(777,'On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(778,'You have lost nothing by them.  No, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(779,'But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(780,'It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(781,'We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(782,'And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(783,'This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?  About a month then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(784,'How did he come?  In answer to an advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(785,'Was he the only applicant?  No, I had a dozen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(786,'Why did you pick him?  Because he was handy, and would come cheap.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(787,'At half-wages, in fact.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(788,'What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(789,'Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(790,'Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(791,'I thought as much, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(792,'Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(793,'He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(794,'Hum! said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(795,'He is still with you?  Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(796,'And has your business been attended to in your absence?  Nothing to complain of, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(797,'There’s never very much to do of a morning.  That will do, Mr. Wilson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(798,'I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(799,'To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(800,'Well, Watson, said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, what do you make of it all?  I make nothing of it, I answered, frankly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(801,'It is a most mysterious business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(802,'As a rule, said Holmes, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(803,'It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(804,'But I must be prompt over this matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(805,'What are you going to do, then? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(806,'To smoke, he answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(807,'It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(808,'He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(809,'I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(810,'Sarasate plays at the St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(811,'James’s Hall this afternoon, he remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(812,'What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?  I have nothing to do to-day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(813,'My practice is never very absorbing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(814,'Then put on your hat and come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(815,'I am going through the city first, and we can have some lunch on the way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(816,'I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(817,'It is introspective, and I want to introspect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(818,'Come along!  We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(819,'It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(820,'Three gilt balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(821,'Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(822,'Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(823,'Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(824,'It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(825,'Thank you, said Holmes, I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(826,'Third right, fourth left, answered the assistant, promptly, closing the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(827,'Smart fellow, that, observed Holmes, as we walked away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(828,'He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(829,'I have known something of him before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(830,'Evidently, said I, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(831,'Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(832,'I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.  Not him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(833,'What then?  The knees of his trousers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(834,'And what did you see?  What I expected to see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(835,'Why did you beat the pavement?  My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(836,'We are spies in an enemy’s country.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(837,'We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(838,'Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(839,'The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(840,'It was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(841,'The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(842,'It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(843,'Let me see, said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along the line, I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(844,'It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(845,'There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(846,'That carries us right on to the other block.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(847,'And now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(848,'A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(849,'My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(850,'All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(851,'In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(852,'The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(853,'Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(854,'When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(855,'James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(856,'You want to go home, no doubt, doctor, he remarked, as we emerged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(857,'Yes, it would be as well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(858,'And I have some business to do which will take some hours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(859,'This business at Coburg Square is serious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(860,'Why serious?  A considerable crime is in contemplation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(861,'I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(862,'But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(863,'I shall want your help to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(864,'At what time?  Ten will be early enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(865,'I shall be at Baker Street at ten.  Very well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(866,'And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(867,'He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(868,'[Illustration: ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS]  I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(869,'Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(870,'As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(871,'What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(872,'I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(873,'It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(874,'Two hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I heard the sound of voices from above.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(875,'On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(876,'Ha! our party is complete, said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(877,'Watson, I think you know Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(878,'Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(879,'Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(880,'We’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see, said Jones, in his consequential way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(881,'Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(882,'All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(883,'I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase, observed Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(884,'Merryweather, gloomily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(885,'You may place considerable confidence in Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(886,'Holmes, sir, said the police agent, loftily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(887,'He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(888,'It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(889,'Oh, if you say so, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(890,'Jones, it is all right, said the stranger, with deference.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(891,'Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(892,'It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(893,'I think you will find, said Sherlock Holmes, that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(894,'Merryweather, the stake will be some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(895,'John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(896,'He’s a young man, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(897,'Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(898,'He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(899,'His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(900,'His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(901,'He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(902,'I’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(903,'I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(904,'I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(905,'John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(906,'It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(907,'If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(908,'Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive, and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(909,'We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farringdon Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(910,'We are close there now, my friend remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(911,'This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(912,'I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(913,'He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(914,'He has one positive virtue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(915,'He is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon any one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(916,'Here we are, and they are waiting for us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(917,'We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(918,'Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(919,'Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(920,'Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(921,'This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(922,'Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(923,'You are not very vulnerable from above, Holmes remarked, as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(924,'Nor from below, said Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(925,'Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(926,'Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow! he remarked, looking up in surprise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(927,'I must really ask you to be a little more quiet, said Holmes, severely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(928,'You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(929,'Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?  The solemn Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(930,'Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(931,'A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in his pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(932,'We have at least an hour before us, he remarked; for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(933,'Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(934,'We are at present, doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(935,'Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(936,'It is our French gold, whispered the director.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(937,'We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(938,'Your French gold?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(939,'We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and borrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(940,'It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(941,'The crate upon which I sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(942,'Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(943,'Which were very well justified, observed Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(944,'And now it is time that we arranged our little plans.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(945,'I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(946,'In the mean time, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(947,'Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(948,'And sit in the dark?  I am afraid so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(949,'I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(950,'But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(951,'And, first of all, we must choose our positions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(952,'These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(953,'I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(954,'Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(955,'If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(956,'I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(957,'Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(958,'The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(959,'To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(960,'They have but one retreat, whispered Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(961,'That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(962,'I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?  I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(963,'Then we have stopped all the holes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(964,'And now we must be silent and wait.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(965,'What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(966,'My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(967,'From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(968,'Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(969,'At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(970,'Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(971,'For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(972,'Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(973,'Its disappearance, however, was but momentary.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(974,'With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(975,'Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(976,'In another instant he stood at the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(977,'It’s all clear, he whispered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(978,'Have you the chisel and the bags.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(979,'Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(980,'The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(982,'It’s no use, John Clay, said Holmes, blandly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(983,'You have no chance at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(984,'So I see, the other answered, with the utmost coolness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(985,'I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(986,'There are three men waiting for him at the door, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(987,'Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(988,'I must compliment you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(989,'And I you, Holmes answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(990,'Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(991,'You’ll see your pal again presently, said Jones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(992,'He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(993,'Just hold out while I fix the derbies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(994,'I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands, remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(995,'You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(996,'Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(997,'’  All right, said Jones, with a stare and a snigger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(998,'Well, would you please, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station?  That is better, said John Clay, serenely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(999,'He made a sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.  Really Mr. Holmes, said Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1000,'Merryweather, as we followed them from the cellar, I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1001,'There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1002,'I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1003,'John Clay, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1004,'I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1005,'*       *       *       *       *  You see, Watson, he explained, in the early hours of the morning, as we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the ‘Encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1006,'It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1007,'The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice’s hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1008,'The £4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1009,'From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1010,'But how could you guess what the motive was?  Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1011,'That, however, was out of the question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1012,'The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1013,'It must, then, be something out of the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1014,'What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1015,'The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1016,'Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1017,'He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1018,'What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1019,'So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1020,'I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1021,'I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1022,'Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1023,'We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1024,'I hardly looked at his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1025,'His knees were what I wished to see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1026,'You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1027,'They spoke of those hours of burrowing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1028,'The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1029,'I walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1030,'When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1031,'And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1032,'Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1033,'Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1034,'But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1035,'Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1036,'For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1037,'You reasoned it out beautifully, I exclaimed, in unfeigned admiration.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1038,'It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1039,'It saved me from ennui, he answered, yawning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1040,'Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1041,'My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1042,'These little problems help me to do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1043,'And you are a benefactor of the race, said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1044,'He shrugged his shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1045,'Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use, he remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1046,'‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1047,'Adventure III  A CASE OF IDENTITY   My dear fellow, said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1048,'We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1049,'If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1050,'And yet I am not convinced of it, I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1051,'The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1052,'We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1053,'A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect, remarked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1054,'This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1055,'Depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1056,'I smiled and shook my head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1057,'I can quite understand you thinking so, I said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1058,'Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1059,'But here—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—let us put it to a practical test.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1060,'Here is the first heading upon which I come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1061,'‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1062,'’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1063,'There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1064,'The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1065,'Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument, said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1066,'This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1067,'The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1068,'Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1069,'He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1070,'Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1071,'Ah, said he, I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1072,'It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1073,'And the ring? I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1074,'It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1075,'And have you any on hand just now? I asked, with interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1076,'Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1077,'They are important, you understand, without being interesting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1078,'Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1079,'The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1080,'In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1081,'It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1082,'He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1083,'Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1084,'From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgetted with her glove buttons.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1085,'Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1086,'I have seen those symptoms before, said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1087,'Oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1088,'She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1089,'And yet even here we may discriminate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1090,'When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1091,'Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1092,'But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1093,'As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1094,'Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into an arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1095,'Do you not find, he said, that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much type-writing?  I did at first, she answered, but now I know where the letters are without looking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1096,'Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1097,'You’ve heard about me, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1098,'Holmes, she cried, else how could you know all that?  Never mind, said Holmes, laughing; it is my business to know things.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1099,'Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1100,'If not, why should you come to consult me?  I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1101,'Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1102,'Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1103,'I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1104,'Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry? asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1105,'Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1106,'Yes, I did bang out of the house, she said, for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1107,'Windibank—that is, my father—took it all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1108,'He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1109,'Your father, said Holmes, your step-father, surely, since the name is different.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1110,'Yes, my step-father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1111,'I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1112,'And your mother is alive?  Oh yes, mother is alive and well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1113,'I wasn’t best pleased, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1114,'Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1115,'Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1116,'Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1117,'Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1118,'They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1119,'I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1120,'Your own little income, he asked, does it come out of the business?  Oh no, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1121,'It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned in Auckland.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1122,'It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1123,'Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1124,'You interest me extremely, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1125,'And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1126,'I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1127,'[Illustration: SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER]  I could do with much less than that, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1128,'Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1129,'Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1130,'Windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at type-writing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1131,'It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1132,'You have made your position very clear to me, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1133,'This is my friend, Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1134,'Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1135,'Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1136,'A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1137,'I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball, she said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1138,'They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1139,'Windibank did not wish us to go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1140,'He never did wish us to go anywhere.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1141,'He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1142,'But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1143,'And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1144,'At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1145,'Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1146,'I suppose, said Holmes, that when Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1147,'Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1148,'Oh, well, he was very good about it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1149,'He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.  I see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1150,'Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1151,'I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1152,'Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1153,'Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1154,'No?  Well, you know, father didn’t like anything of the sort.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1155,'He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1156,'But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.  But how about Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1157,'Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?  Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1158,'We could write in the mean time, and he used to write every day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1159,'I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1160,'Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?  Oh yes, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1161,'We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1162,'Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—  What office?  That’s the worst of it, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1163,'Holmes, I don’t know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1164,'Where did he live, then?  He slept on the premises.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1165,'And you don’t know his address?  No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1166,'Where did you address your letters, then?  To the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1167,'He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to type-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1168,'That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1169,'Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1170,'It was most suggestive, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1171,'It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1172,'Can you remember any other little things about Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1173,'Hosmer Angel?  He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1174,'He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1175,'Very retiring and gentlemanly he was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1176,'Even his voice was gentle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1177,'He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1178,'He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1179,'Well, and what happened when Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1180,'Windibank, your step-father, returned to France?  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1181,'Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should marry before father came back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1182,'He was in dreadful earnest, and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1183,'Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1184,'Mother was all in his favor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1185,'Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1186,'I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1187,'It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1188,'It missed him, then?  Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1189,'Ha! that was unfortunate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1190,'Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1191,'Was it to be in church?  Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1192,'Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1193,'Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1194,'We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1195,'That was last Friday, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1196,'Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1197,'It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1198,'Oh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1199,'Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1200,'It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1201,'Most certainly it does.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1202,'Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1203,'I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1204,'And then I think that what he foresaw happened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1205,'But you have no notion as to what it could have been?  None.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1207,'How did your mother take the matter?  She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1208,'And your father? Did you tell him?  Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1209,'As he said, what interest could any one have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of mine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1210,'And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can’t sleep a wink at night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1211,'She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to sob heavily into it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1212,'I shall glance into the case for you, said Holmes, rising; and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1229,'Holmes, but I cannot do that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1230,'I shall be true to Hosmer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1231,'He shall find me ready when he comes back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1232,'For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1233,'She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1234,'Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1235,'Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1236,'Quite an interesting study, that maiden, he observed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1237,'I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1238,'You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1239,'Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1240,'But the maiden herself was most instructive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1241,'You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me, I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1242,'Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1243,'You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1245,'Now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1246,'Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1247,'Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1248,'Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1249,'Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right forefinger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1250,'Her boots I didn’t observe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1251,'She had small, round, hanging gold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1252,'Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1253,'’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1254,'You have really done very well indeed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1255,'It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for color.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1256,'Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1257,'My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1258,'In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1259,'As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1260,'The double line a little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1261,'The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1262,'I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.  It surprised me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1263,'But, surely, it was very obvious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1264,'I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1265,'One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1266,'Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1267,'And what else? I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1268,'I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home, but after being fully dressed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1269,'You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1270,'She had written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1271,'It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1272,'All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1273,'Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1274,'Hosmer Angel?  I held the little printed slip to the light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1275,'Missing, it said, on the morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft. 7 in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1276,'in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1277,'Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1278,'Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1279,'Anybody bringing, etc., etc.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1280,'That will do, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1281,'As to the letters, he continued, glancing over them, they are very commonplace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1282,'Absolutely no clew in them to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1283,'Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1284,'There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1285,'They are type-written, I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1286,'Not only that, but the signature is type-written.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1287,'Look at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1288,'There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1289,'The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1290,'Of what?  My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?  I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1291,'No, that was not the point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1292,'However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1293,'One is to a firm in the city, the other is to the young lady’s step-father, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1294,'Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1295,'It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1296,'And now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1297,'I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1298,'Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1299,'I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1300,'A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1301,'It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1302,'I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his arm-chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1303,'A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1304,'Well, have you solved it? I asked, as I entered.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1305,'It was the bisulphate of baryta.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1306,'No, no, the mystery! I cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1307,'Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1308,'There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1309,'The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1310,'Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?  The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a tap at the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1311,'This is the girl’s step-father, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1312,'James Windibank, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1313,'He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1314,'Come in!  The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating gray eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1315,'He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.  Good-evening, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1316,'James Windibank, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1317,'I think that this type-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o’clock?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1318,'I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1319,'I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1320,'It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1321,'Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1322,'Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?  On the contrary, said Holmes, quietly; I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1323,'Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1324,'I am delighted to hear it, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1325,'It is a curious thing, remarked Holmes, that a type-writer has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1326,'Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1327,'Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1328,'Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1329,'Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1330,'’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1331,'We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn, our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1332,'And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1333,'Windibank, Holmes continued.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1334,'I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1335,'It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1336,'I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1337,'They are all type-written.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1338,'In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1339,'Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1340,'I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1341,'If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1342,'Certainly, said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1343,'I let you know, then, that I have caught him!  What! where? shouted Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1344,'Windibank, turning white to his lips, and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1345,'Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t, said Holmes, suavely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1346,'There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1347,'It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1348,'That’s right! Sit down, and let us talk it over.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1349,'Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter of moisture on his brow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1350,'It—it’s not actionable, he stammered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1351,'I am very much afraid that it is not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1352,'But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1353,'Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1354,'The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1355,'Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1356,'The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money, said he, and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1357,'It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1358,'It was worth an effort to preserve it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1359,'The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1360,'Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her step-father do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1361,'But soon he found that that would not answer forever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1362,'She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1363,'What does her clever step-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1364,'With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1365,'Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1366,'[Illustration: GLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP]  It was only a joke at first, groaned our visitor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1367,'We never thought that she would have been so carried away.  Very likely not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1368,'However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her step-father was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1369,'She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1370,'Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go, if a real effect were to be produced.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1371,'There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards any one else.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1372,'But the deception could not be kept up forever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1373,'These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1374,'The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1375,'Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1376,'James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1377,'As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1378,'I think that that was the chain of events, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1379,'Windibank!  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1380,'It may be so, or it may not, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1381,'Holmes, said he, but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1382,'I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1383,'The law cannot, as you say, touch you, said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1384,'If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1385,'By Jove! he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to— He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1386,'James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1387,'There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel! said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1388,'That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1389,'The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1390,'I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning, I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1391,'Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1392,'Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the step-father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1393,'Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1394,'So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1395,'My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1396,'You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1397,'And how did you verify them?  Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1398,'I knew the firm for which this man worked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1399,'Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1400,'I had already noticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address, asking him if he would come here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1401,'As I expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1402,'The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1403,'_Voila tout!_  And Miss Sutherland?  If I tell her she will not believe me.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1429,'Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and tossed them up onto the rack.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1430,'Have you heard anything of the case? he asked.  Not a word.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1431,'I have not seen a paper for some days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1432,'The London press has not had very full accounts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1433,'I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1434,'It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1435,'That sounds a little paradoxical.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1436,'But it is profoundly true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1437,'Singularity is almost invariably a clew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1438,'The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is it to bring it home.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1446,'One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1447,'Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1448,'The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1449,'Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1450,'McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1451,'They appear to have avoided the society of the neighboring English families, and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighborhood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1452,'McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1453,'Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1455,'On June 3, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1460,'Both these witnesses depose that Mr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1465,'To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1469,'A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1470,'She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1473,'She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1474,'She had hardly said the words when young Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1475,'McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1476,'He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1477,'On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the Pool.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1478,'The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1479,'The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1480,'Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘Wilful Murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next assizes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1481,'Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1482,'I could hardly imagine a more damning case, I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1483,'If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1484,'Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing, answered Holmes, thoughtfully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1485,'It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1486,'It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1487,'There are several people in the neighborhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1488,'Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1489,'I am afraid, said I, that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1490,'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact, he answered, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1491,'Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1496,'I know the military neatness which characterizes you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1497,'You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less well illuminated than the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1498,'I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and being satisfied with such a result.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1499,'I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1500,'Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1501,'There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1502,'[Illustration: THEY FOUND THE BODY]  What are they?  It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1503,'On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1504,'This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1505,'It was a confession, I ejaculated.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1506,'No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1507,'Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1508,'On the contrary, said Holmes, it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1509,'However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1510,'Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1511,'His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1512,'As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1513,'The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind, rather than of a guilty one.  I shook my head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1514,'Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence, I remarked.  So they have.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1515,'And many men have been wrongfully hanged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1516,'What is the young man’s own account of the matter?  It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1517,'You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1518,'He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1519,'I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read it very carefully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1520,'It ran in this way:  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1521,'James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1522,'My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1523,'Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1524,'I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren which is upon the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1525,'On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1526,'I had no idea that he was in front of me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1527,'When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of Cooee! which was a usual signal between my father and myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1528,'I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1529,'He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1530,'A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1531,'Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned towards Hatherley Farm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1532,'I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1533,'I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1534,'I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1535,'I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1536,'Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1537,'I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1538,'He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1541,'The Coroner: What did you understand by that?  Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1542,'I thought that he was delirious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1543,'The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?  Witness: I should prefer not to answer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1544,'The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1545,'Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1546,'I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1547,'The Coroner: That is for the court to decide.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1548,'I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1549,'Witness: I must still refuse.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1550,'The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father?  Witness: It was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1551,'The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?  Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1552,'A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?  Witness: Nothing definite.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1553,'The Coroner: What do you mean?  Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1554,'Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1555,'It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1556,'When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1557,'‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’  ‘Yes, it was gone.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1562,'’  This concluded the examination of the witness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1563,'I see, said I, as I glanced down the column, that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1564,'He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1565,'They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1566,'Holmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1567,'Both you and the coroner have been at some pains, said he, to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1568,'Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1569,'Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1570,'No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1571,'And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1572,'We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1573,'It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1574,'A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1575,'In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1576,'With him we drove to the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1577,'I have ordered a carriage, said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of tea.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1578,'I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1579,'It was very nice and complimentary of you, Holmes answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1580,'It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1581,'Lestrade looked startled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1582,'I do not quite follow, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1583,'How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1584,'No wind, and not a cloud in the sky.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1585,'I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1586,'I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1587,'Lestrade laughed indulgently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1588,'You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1589,'The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1590,'Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1591,'She had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1592,'Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1593,'He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1594,'Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.  Oh, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1595,'Sherlock Holmes! she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, I am so glad that you have come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1596,'I have driven down to tell you so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1597,'I know that James didn’t do it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1598,'I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1599,'Never let yourself doubt upon that point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1600,'We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1601,'Such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1602,'I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner, said Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1603,'You may rely upon my doing all that I can.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1604,'But you have read the evidence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1605,'You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?  I think that it is very probable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1606,'There, now! she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly at Lestrade.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1607,'You hear! He gives me hopes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1608,'Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1609,'I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions, he said.  But he is right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1610,'Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1611,'And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1612,'In what way? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1613,'It is no time for me to hide anything.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1614,'James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1615,'McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1616,'James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1617,'So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1618,'And your father? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1619,'Was he in favor of such a union?  No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1620,'McCarthy was in favor of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1621,'A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1622,'Thank you for this information, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1623,'May I see your father if I call to-morrow?  I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1624,'The doctor?  Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1625,'He has taken to his bed, and Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1626,'Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1627,'McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1628,'Ha! In Victoria! That is important.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1629,'Yes, at the mines.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1630,'Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1631,'Turner made his money.  Yes, certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1632,'Thank you, Miss Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1633,'You have been of material assistance to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1634,'You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1635,'No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1636,'Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1637,'I will, Miss Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1638,'I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1639,'Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1640,'She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1641,'I am ashamed of you, Holmes, said Lestrade, with dignity, after a few minutes’ silence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1642,'Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1643,'I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1644,'Have you an order to see him in prison?  Yes, but only for you and me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1645,'Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1646,'We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?  Ample.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1647,'Then let us do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1648,'Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1649,'I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1650,'The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1651,'Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1652,'What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell, and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1653,'In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1654,'I marked the spot upon my own head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1655,'Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1656,'That was to some extent in favor of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1657,'Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1658,'Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’s attention to it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1659,'Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1660,'What could that mean? It could not be delirium.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1661,'A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1662,'No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1663,'But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1664,'And then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1665,'If that were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1666,'What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’s insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1667,'It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1668,'He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1669,'The glass still keeps very high, he remarked, as he sat down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1670,'It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1671,'On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1672,'I have seen young McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1673,'And what did you learn from him?  Nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1674,'Could he throw no light?  None at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1675,'I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as every one else.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1676,'He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1677,'I cannot admire his taste, I remarked, if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1678,'Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1679,'This fellow is madly, insanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol, and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1680,'It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1681,'On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1682,'It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1683,'Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1684,'I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1685,'But if he is innocent, who has done it?  Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1686,'One is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the Pool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1687,'The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1688,'Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1689,'And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1690,'There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1691,'At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1692,'There is serious news this morning, Lestrade observed. It is said that Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1693,'Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1694,'An elderly man, I presume? said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1695,'About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1696,'This business has had a very bad effect upon him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1697,'He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1698,'Indeed! That is interesting, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1699,'Oh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1700,'Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1701,'Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1702,'The daughter told us as much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1703,'Do you not deduce something from that?  We have got to the deductions and the inferences, said Lestrade, winking at me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1704,'I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1705,'You are right, said Holmes, demurely; you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1706,'Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of, replied Lestrade, with some warmth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1707,'And that is—  That McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1708,'Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog, said Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1709,'But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.  Yes, that is it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1710,'It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the gray walls.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1711,'The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1712,'We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’s request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1713,'Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1714,'[Illustration: THE MAID SHOWED US THE BOOTS.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1715,']  Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1716,'Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognize him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1717,'His face flushed and darkened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1718,'His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1719,'His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1720,'His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1721,'Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1722,'It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1723,'Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little _détour_ into the meadow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1724,'Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1725,'The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1726,'Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner’s dwelling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1727,'On the Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1728,'Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1729,'To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1730,'He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1731,'What did you go into the Pool for? he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1732,'I fished about with a rake.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1733,'I thought there might be some weapon or other trace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1734,'But how on earth—  Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1735,'A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1736,'Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all over it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1737,'Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1738,'But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1739,'He drew out a lens, and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1740,'These are young McCarthy’s feet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1741,'Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1742,'That bears out his story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1743,'He ran when he saw his father on the ground.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1744,'Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1745,'What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1746,'And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1747,'Now where did they come from? He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighborhood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1748,'Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1749,'For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and examining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1750,'A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1751,'Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all traces were lost.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1752,'It has been a case of considerable interest, he remarked, returning to his natural manner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1753,'I fancy that this gray house on the right must be the lodge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1754,'I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1755,'Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1756,'You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1757,'It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1758,'This may interest you, Lestrade, he remarked, holding it out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1759,'The murder was done with it.  I see no marks.  There are none.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1760,'How do you know, then?  The grass was growing under it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1761,'It had only lain there a few days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1762,'There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1763,'It corresponds with the injuries.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1764,'There is no sign of any other weapon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1765,'And the murderer?  Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1766,'There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.  Lestrade laughed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1767,'I am afraid that I am still a sceptic, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1768,'Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1769,'_Nous verrons_, answered Holmes, calmly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1770,'You work your own method, and I shall work mine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1771,'I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1772,'And leave your case unfinished?  No, finished.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1773,'But the mystery?  It is solved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1774,'Who was the criminal, then?  The gentleman I describe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1775,'But who is he?  Surely it would not be difficult to find out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1776,'This is not such a populous neighborhood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1777,'Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1778,'I am a practical man, he said, and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1779,'I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1780,'All right, said Holmes, quietly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1781,'I have given you the chance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1782,'Here are your lodgings. Good-bye.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1783,'I shall drop you a line before I leave.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1784,'Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1785,'Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1786,'Look here, Watson, he said, when the cloth was cleared; just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1787,'I don’t quite know what to do, and I should value your advice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1788,'Light a cigar, and let me expound.  Pray do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1789,'Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favor and you against him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1790,'One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1791,'The other was his singular dying reference to a rat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1792,'He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1793,'Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1794,'What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?  Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1795,'The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1796,'It was mere chance that he was within ear-shot.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1797,'The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1798,'But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1799,'There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1800,'What of the rat, then?  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1801,'This is a map of the Colony of Victoria, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1802,'I wired to Bristol for it last night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1803,'He put his hand over part of the map.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1804,'What do you read? he asked.  ARAT, I read.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1805,'And now? He raised his hand.  BALLARAT.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1806,'That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1807,'He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1808,'So-and-so, of Ballarat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1809,'It is wonderful! I exclaimed.  It is obvious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1810,'And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1811,'The possession of a gray garment was a third point which, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1812,'We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a gray cloak.  Certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1813,'And one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1814,'Then comes our expedition of to-day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1815,'By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1816,'But how did you gain them?  You know my method.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1817,'It is founded upon the observance of trifles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1818,'His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1819,'His boots, too, might be told from their traces.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1820,'Yes, they were peculiar boots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1821,'But his lameness?  The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1822,'He put less weight upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1823,'Why? Because he limped—he was lame.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1824,'But his left-handedness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1825,'You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1826,'The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1827,'Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1828,'He had even smoked there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1829,'I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled me to pronounce as an Indian cigar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1830,'I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1831,'Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1832,'It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1833,'And the cigar-holder?  I could see that the end had not been in his mouth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1834,'Therefore he used a holder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1835,'The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1836,'Holmes, I said, you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1837,'I see the direction in which all this points.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1838,'The culprit is—  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1839,'John Turner, cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1840,'The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1841,'His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1842,'His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1843,'It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1844,'Pray sit down on the sofa, said Holmes, gently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1845,'You had my note?  Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1846,'You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1847,'I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1848,'And why did you wish to see me? He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1849,'Yes, said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. It is so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1850,'I know all about McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1851,'The old man sank his face in his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1852,'God help me! he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1853,'But I would not have let the young man come to harm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1854,'I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1855,'I am glad to hear you say so, said Holmes, gravely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1856,'I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1857,'It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1858,'It may not come to that, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1859,'What!  I am no official agent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1860,'I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1861,'Young McCarthy must be got off, however.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1862,'I am a dying man, said old Turner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1863,'I have had diabetes for years.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1864,'My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1865,'Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a jail.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1866,'Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1867,'Just tell us the truth, he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1868,'I shall jot down the facts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1869,'You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1870,'Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1871,'I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1872,'It’s as well, said the old man; it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1873,'And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1874,'You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1875,'He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1876,'God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1877,'His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1878,'I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1879,'It was in the early sixties at the diggings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1880,'I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1881,'There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1882,'Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1883,'One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1884,'There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1885,'Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1886,'I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1887,'I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(1888,'We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2099,'I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2100,'Tut! tut! cried Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2101,'You must act, man, or you are lost.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2102,'Nothing but energy can save you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2103,'This is no time for despair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2104,'I have seen the police.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2105,'Ah!  But they listened to my story with a smile.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2106,'I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2107,'Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2108,'Incredible imbecility! he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2109,'They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2110,'Has he come with you to-night?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2111,'His orders were to stay in the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2112,'Again Holmes raved in the air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2113,'Why did you come to me? he said; and, above all, why did you not come at once?  I did not know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2114,'It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2115,'It is really two days since you had the letter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2116,'We should have acted before this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2117,'You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?  There is one thing, said John Openshaw.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2118,'He rummaged in his coat pocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2119,'I have some remembrance, said he, that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular color.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2120,'I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped destruction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2121,'Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2122,'I think myself that it is a page from some private diary.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2123,'The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2124,'Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2125,'It was headed, March, 1869, and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:  4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.  7th.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2126,'Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St. Augustine.  9th. McCauley cleared.  10th. John Swain cleared.  12th. Visited Paramore. All well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2127,'Thank you! said Holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to our visitor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2128,'And now you must on no account lose another instant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2129,'We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2130,'You must get home instantly and act.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2131,'What shall I do?  There is but one thing to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2132,'It must be done at once.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2133,'You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2134,'You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2135,'You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2136,'Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2137,'Do you understand?  Entirely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2138,'Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2139,'I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2140,'The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2141,'The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2142,'I thank you, said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2143,'You have given me fresh life and hope.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2144,'I shall certainly do as you advise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2145,'Do not lose an instant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2146,'And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2147,'How do you go back?  By train from Waterloo.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2148,'It is not yet nine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2149,'The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2150,'And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.  I am armed.  That is well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2151,'To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2152,'I shall see you at Horsham, then?  No, your secret lies in London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2153,'It is there that I shall seek it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2154,'Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2155,'I shall take your advice in every particular.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2156,'He shook hands with us, and took his leave.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2157,'Outside the wind still screamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2158,'This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2159,'Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2160,'Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2161,'I think, Watson, he remarked at last, that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2162,'Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.  Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2163,'And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2164,'But have you, I asked, formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?  There can be no question as to their nature, he answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2165,'Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2166,', and why does he pursue this unhappy family?  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2167,'The ideal reasoner, he remarked, would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2168,'As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2169,'We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2170,'Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2171,'To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2172,'It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavored in my case to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2173,'If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2174,'Yes, I answered, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2175,'It was a singular document.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2176,'Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2177,'Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2178,'Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2179,'Holmes grinned at the last item.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2180,'Well, he said, I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2181,'Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2182,'Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2183,'Now let us consider the situation, and see what may be deduced from it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2184,'In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2185,'Men at his time of life do not change all their habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2186,'His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of some one or something which drove him from America.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2187,'As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2188,'Did you remark the post-marks of those letters?  The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.  From East London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2189,'What do you deduce from that?  They are all seaports.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2190,'That the writer was on board of a ship.  Excellent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2191,'We have already a clew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2192,'There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2193,'And now let us consider another point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2194,'In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2195,'Does that suggest anything?  A greater distance to travel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2196,'But the letter had also a greater distance to come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2197,'Then I do not see the point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2198,'There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2199,'It looks as if they always sent their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2200,'You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2201,'If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2202,'But as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2203,'I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the sailing-vessel which brought the writer.  It is possible.  More than that. It is probable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2204,'And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2205,'The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2206,'But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2207,'Good God! I cried; what can it mean, this relentless persecution?  The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2208,'I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2209,'A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2210,'There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2211,'Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2212,'In this way you see K. K. K.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2213,'ceases to be the initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2214,'But of what society?  Have you never— said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?  I never have.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2215,'Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2216,'Here it is, said he, presently, ‘Ku Klux Klan.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2217,'A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2218,'This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2219,'Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro voters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2220,'Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognized shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2221,'On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2222,'If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2223,'So perfect was the organization of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2224,'For some years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the United States Government and of the better classes of the community in the South.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2225,'Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2226,'’  You will observe, said Holmes, laying down the volume, that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2227,'It may well have been cause and effect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2228,'It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2229,'You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2230,'Then the page we have seen—  Is such as we might expect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2231,'It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C,’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2232,'Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2233,'Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the mean time is to do what I have told him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2234,'There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2235,'*       *       *       *       *  It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2236,'Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2237,'You will excuse me for not waiting for you, said he; I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2238,'What steps will you take? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2239,'It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2240,'I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2241,'You will not go there first?  No, I shall commence with the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2242,'Just ring the bell, and the maid will bring up your coffee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2243,'As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2244,'It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2245,'Holmes, I cried, you are too late.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2246,'Ah! said he, laying down his cup, I feared as much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2247,'How was it done? He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2248,'My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading, ‘Tragedy near Waterloo Bridge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2249,'’ Here is the account: ‘Between nine and ten last night Police-constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2250,'The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2251,'The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2252,'It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2253,'It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2254,'The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the river-side landing-stages.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2255,'’  We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2256,'That hurts my pride, Watson, he said, at last.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2257,'It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2258,'It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2259,'That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death—! He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2260,'They must be cunning devils, he exclaimed, at last.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2261,'How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2262,'The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2263,'Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2264,'I am going out now!  [Illustration: ‘HOLMES,’ I CRIED, ‘YOU ARE TOO LATE’]  To the police?  No; I shall be my own police.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2265,'When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2266,'All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2267,'Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2268,'It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2269,'He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the loaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2270,'You are hungry, I remarked.  Starving.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2271,'It had escaped my memory.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2272,'I have had nothing since breakfast.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2273,'Nothing?  Not a bite.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2274,'I had no time to think of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2275,'And how have you succeeded?  Well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2276,'You have a clew?  I have them in the hollow of my hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2277,'Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2278,'Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2279,'It is well thought of!  What do you mean?  He took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he squeezed out the pips upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2280,'Of these he took five, and thrust them into an envelope.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2281,'On the inside of the flap he wrote S. H. for J. O.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2282,'Then he sealed it and addressed it to Captain James Calhoun, Bark _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2283,'That will await him when he enters port, said he, chuckling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2284,'It may give him a sleepless night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2285,'He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2286,'And who is this Captain Calhoun?  The leader of the gang.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2287,'I shall have the others, but he first.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2288,'How did you trace it, then?  He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2289,'I have spent the whole day, said he, over Lloyd’s registers and the files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2290,'There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2291,'Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the Union.  Texas, I think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2292,'I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2293,'What then?  I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the bark _Lone Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2294,'I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2295,'Yes?  The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2296,'I went down to the Albert Dock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2297,'I wired to Gravesend, and learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is easterly, I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins, and not very far from the Isle of Wight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2298,'What will you do, then?  Oh, I have my hand upon him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2299,'He and the two mates, are, as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2300,'The others are Finns and Germans.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2301,'I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2302,'I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2303,'By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2304,'There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2305,'Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2306,'We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of Savannah, but none ever reached us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2307,'We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters L. S.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2308,'carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone Star_.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2312,'The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2313,'He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2322,'You will excuse my calling so late, she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2331,'Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?  Oh, no, no! I want the Doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2332,'He has not been home for two days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2333,'I am so frightened about him!  It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2334,'We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2335,'Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?  It seemed that it was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2336,'She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2337,'Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2338,'But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2339,'There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2340,'But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?  There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2341,'Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2342,'I could manage it better if I were alone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2343,'I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2344,'And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2345,'But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2346,'Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2348,'Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2349,'Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the new-comer.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2351,'The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2352,'At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2353,'As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.  Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2354,'I have not come to stay, said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2355,'There is a friend of mine here, Mr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2365,'Your wife has been waiting this two days for you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2366,'You should be ashamed of yourself!  So I am.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2367,'But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2369,'I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2370,'Give me your hand! Have you a cab?  Yes, I have one waiting.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2372,'But I must owe something.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2373,'Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off color.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2374,'I can do nothing for myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2375,'I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2376,'As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, Walk past me, and then look back at me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2377,'The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2378,'They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2379,'I took two steps forward and looked back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2380,'It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2381,'He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2382,'His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2383,'He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2384,'Holmes! I whispered, what on earth are you doing in this den?  As low as you can, he answered; I have excellent ears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2385,'If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2386,'I have a cab outside.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2387,'Then pray send him home in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2388,'You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2389,'I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2390,'If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2391,'It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’s requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2392,'I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2394,'In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2395,'For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2396,'Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2397,'I suppose, Watson, said he, that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2398,'I was certainly surprised to find you there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2399,'But not more so than I to find you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2400,'I came to find a friend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2401,'And I to find an enemy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2402,'An enemy?  Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2403,'Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2404,'Had I been recognized in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2405,'There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2407,'We should be rich men if we had £1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2408,'It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole river-side, and I fear that Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2409,'Clair has entered it never to leave it more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2410,'But our trap should be here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2411,'He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2412,'Now, Watson, said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2413,'You’ll come with me, won’t you?  If I can be of use.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2414,'Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2415,'My room at ‘The Cedars’ is a double-bedded one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2416,'‘The Cedars?’  Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2417,'I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2418,'Where is it, then?  Near Lee, in Kent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2419,'We have a seven-mile drive before us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2420,'But I am all in the dark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2421,'Of course you are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2422,'You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2423,'All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2424,'Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2425,'So long, then!  He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2426,'Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2427,'A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2428,'Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2429,'We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2430,'You have a grand gift of silence, Watson, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2431,'It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2432,'’Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over pleasant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2433,'I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2434,'You forget that I know nothing about it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2435,'I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2436,'It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing to go upon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2437,'There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2438,'Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.  Proceed, then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2439,'Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2440,'Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2441,'He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2442,'By degrees he made friends in the neighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2443,'He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2444,'14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2445,'Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2446,'I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10_s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2447,'_, while he has £220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2448,'There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.  Last Monday Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2449,'Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2450,'Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2451,'Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the offices of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2452,'Clair had her lunch, started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2453,'35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2454,'Have you followed me so far?  It is very clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2455,'If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2456,'Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2457,'While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2458,'The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2459,'He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2460,'One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2461,'[Illustration: AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SHE MET THIS LASCAR SCOUNDREL.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2462,']  Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and, running through the front room, she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2463,'At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2464,'Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in Fresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2465,'The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and, in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2466,'Clair had last been seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2467,'There was no sign of him there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2468,'In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2469,'Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2470,'So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2471,'Clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid from it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2472,'Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2473,'It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2474,'This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realize that the matter was serious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2475,'The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2476,'The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2477,'Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2478,'The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened from below.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2479,'On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the window-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2480,'Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2481,'Clair, with the exception of his coat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2482,'His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2483,'There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2484,'Out of the window he must apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2485,'And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2486,'The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2487,'Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2488,'His defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2489,'So much for the Lascar manager.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2490,'Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2491,'His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2492,'He is a professional beggar, though, in order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2493,'Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2494,'Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is a piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2495,'I have watched the fellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2496,'His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2497,'A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2498,'This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2499,'But a cripple! said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2500,'What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?  He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2501,'Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2502,'Pray continue your narrative.  Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2503,'Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2504,'Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2505,'One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2506,'There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2507,'He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2508,'Clair, and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2509,'Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2510,'He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2511,'And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2512,'Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2513,'Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2514,'And what do you think they found in the pockets?  I cannot imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2515,'No, I don’t think you would guess.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2516,'Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2517,'It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2518,'But a human body is a different matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2519,'There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2520,'It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2521,'But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2522,'Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?  No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2523,'Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2524,'Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2525,'What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2526,'He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2527,'He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2528,'There is not an instant to be lost.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2529,'He rushes to some secret horde, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2530,'He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2531,'It certainly sounds feasible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2532,'Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2534,'He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2535,'There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2536,'Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2537,'I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2538,'While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2539,'Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2540,'We are on the outskirts of Lee, said my companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2541,'We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2542,'See that light among the trees? That is ‘The Cedars,’ and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2543,'But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street? I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2544,'Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2545,'Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2546,'I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2547,'Whoa, there, whoa!  We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2548,'A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and, springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2549,'As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2550,'She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2551,'Well? she cried, well? And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2552,'No good news?  None.  No bad?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2553,'Thank God for that. But come in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2554,'You must be weary, for you have had a long day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2555,'This is my friend, Dr. Watson.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2558,'You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2560,'If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.  Now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2561,'Sherlock Holmes, said the lady, as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.  Certainly, madam.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2562,'Do not trouble about my feelings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2563,'I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2564,'I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2565,'Upon what point?  In your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive?  Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2566,'Frankly, now! she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2567,'Frankly, then, madam, I do not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2568,'You think that he is dead?  I do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2569,'Murdered?  I don’t say that. Perhaps.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2570,'And on what day did he meet his death?  On Monday.  Then perhaps, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2571,'Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2572,'Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.  What! he roared.  Yes, to-day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2573,'She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2574,'May I see it?  Certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2575,'He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2576,'I had left my chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2577,'The envelope was a very coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend post-mark, and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2578,'Coarse writing, murmured Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2579,'Surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2580,'No, but the enclosure is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2581,'I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2582,'How can you tell that?  The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2583,'The rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2584,'If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2585,'This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2586,'It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2587,'Let us now see the letter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2588,'Ha! there has been an enclosure here!  Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2589,'And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?  One of his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2590,'One?  His hand when he wrote hurriedly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2591,'It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2592,'‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2593,'There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—Neville.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2594,'’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2595,'Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2596,'Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2597,'And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?  None.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2598,'Neville wrote those words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2599,'And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2600,'Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2601,'But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2602,'Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2603,'The ring, after all, proves nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2604,'It may have been taken from him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2605,'No, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!  Very well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2606,'It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only posted to-day.  That is possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2607,'If so, much may have happened between.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2608,'Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2609,'I know that all is well with him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2610,'There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2611,'On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2612,'Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his death?  I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2613,'And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2614,'But if your husband is alive, and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?  I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2615,'And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2616,'And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?  Very much so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2617,'Was the window open?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2618,'Then he might have called to you?  He might.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2619,'He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2620,'A call for help, you thought?  Yes. He waved his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2621,'But it might have been a cry of surprise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2622,'Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?  It is possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2623,'And you thought he was pulled back?  He disappeared so suddenly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2624,'He might have leaped back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2625,'You did not see any one else in the room?  No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2626,'Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?  But without his collar or tie.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2627,'I distinctly saw his bare throat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2628,'Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?  Never.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2629,'Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?  Never.  Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2630,'Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2631,'We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2632,'A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2633,'Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed it, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2634,'It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2635,'He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and arm-chairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2636,'With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2637,'In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2638,'So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2639,'The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2640,'Awake, Watson? he asked.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2641,'Game for a morning drive?  Certainly.  Then dress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2642,'No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2643,'He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2644,'As I dressed I glanced at my watch.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2645,'It was no wonder that no one was stirring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2646,'It was twenty-five minutes past four.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2647,'I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2648,'I want to test a little theory of mine, said he, pulling on his boots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2649,'I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2650,'I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2651,'But I think I have the key of the affair now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2652,'And where is it? I asked, smiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2653,'In the bath-room, he answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2654,'Oh yes, I am not joking, he continued, seeing my look of incredulity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2655,'I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2656,'Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2657,'We made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2658,'In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2659,'We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2660,'A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2661,'It has been in some points a singular case, said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2662,'I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2663,'In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2664,'Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found ourselves in Bow Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2665,'Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force, and the two constables at the door saluted him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2666,'One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2667,'Who is on duty? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2668,'Inspector Bradstreet, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2669,'Ah, Bradstreet, how are you? A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2670,'I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.  Certainly, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2671,'Step into my room here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2672,'It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2673,'The inspector sat down at his desk.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2674,'What can I do for you, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2675,'Holmes?  I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2676,'He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.  So I heard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2677,'You have him here?  In the cells.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2678,'Is he quiet?  Oh, he gives no trouble.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2679,'But he is a dirty scoundrel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2680,'Dirty?  Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2681,'Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2682,'I should like to see him very much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2683,'Would you? That is easily done. Come this way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2684,'You can leave your bag.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2685,'No, I think that I’ll take it.  Very good.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2686,'Come this way, if you please.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2687,'He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2688,'The third on the right is his, said the inspector.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2689,'Here it is! He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2690,'He is asleep, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2691,'You can see him very well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2692,'We both put our eyes to the grating.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2693,'The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2694,'He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2695,'He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2696,'A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2697,'A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2698,'He’s a beauty, isn’t he? said the inspector.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2699,'He certainly needs a wash, remarked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2700,'I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2701,'He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2702,'He! he! You are a funny one, chuckled the inspector.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2703,'Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2704,'Well, I don’t know why not, said the inspector.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2705,'He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he? He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2706,'The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2707,'Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2708,'Let me introduce you, he shouted, to Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2709,'Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2710,'Never in my life have I seen such a sight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2711,'The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2712,'Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2713,'Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a scream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2714,'Great heavens! cried the inspector, it is, indeed, the missing man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2715,'I know him from the photograph.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2716,'The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. Be it so, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2717,'And pray, what am I charged with?  With making away with Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2718,'—— Oh, come, you can’t be charged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it, said the inspector, with a grin.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2719,'Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.  If I am Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2720,'Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2721,'No crime, but a very great error has been committed, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2722,'You would have done better to have trusted your wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2723,'It was not the wife, it was the children, groaned the prisoner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2724,'God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2725,'My God! What an exposure! What can I do?  Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2726,'If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up, said he, of course you can hardly avoid publicity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2727,'On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2728,'Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the proper authorities.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2729,'The case would then never go into court at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2730,'God bless you! cried the prisoner, passionately.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2731,'I would have endured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2732,'You are the first who have ever heard my story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2733,'My father was a school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2734,'I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2735,'One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2736,'There was the point from which all my adventures started.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2737,'It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2738,'When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2739,'I took advantage now of my attainments.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2740,'I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2741,'Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the busiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a beggar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2742,'For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than 26_s._ 4_d.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2743,'_  I wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon me for £25.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2744,'I was at my wits’ end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2745,'I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2746,'In ten days I had the money, and had paid the debt.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2747,'Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £2 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2748,'It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2749,'Only one man knew my secret.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2750,'He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar, and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2751,'This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2752,'Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2753,'I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized character in the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2754,'All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £2.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2755,'As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my real occupation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2756,'My dear wife knew that I had business in the city.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2757,'She little knew what.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2758,'Last Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room above the opium den, when I looked out of my window, and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2759,'I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent any one from coming up to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2760,'I heard her voice down-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2761,'Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2762,'Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2763,'But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2764,'I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2765,'Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2766,'I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2767,'The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2768,'Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2769,'I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2770,'I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2771,'Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2772,'That note only reached her yesterday, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2773,'Good God! What a week she must have spent!  The police have watched this Lascar, said Inspector Bradstreet, and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2774,'Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2775,'That was it, said Holmes, nodding approvingly; I have no doubt of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2776,'But have you never been prosecuted for begging?  Many times; but what was a fine to me?  It must stop here, however, said Bradstreet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2777,'If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2778,'I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2779,'In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2780,'But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2781,'Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2782,'I wish I knew how you reach your results.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2783,'I reached this one, said my friend, by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2784,'I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2785,'Adventure VII  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE   I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2786,'He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2787,'Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2788,'A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2789,'You are engaged, said I; perhaps I interrupt you.  Not at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2790,'I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2791,'The matter is a perfectly trivial one (he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat), but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2792,'I seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2793,'I suppose, I remarked, that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.  No, no.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2794,'No crime, said Sherlock Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2795,'Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2796,'Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2797,'We have already had experience of such.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2798,'So much so, I remarked, that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.  Precisely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2799,'You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2800,'Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2801,'You know Peterson, the commissionaire?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2802,'It is to him that this trophy belongs.  It is his hat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2803,'No, no; he found it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2804,'Its owner is unknown.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2805,'I beg that you will look upon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2806,'And, first, as to how it came here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2807,'It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2808,'The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2809,'In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2810,'As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2811,'One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2812,'Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2813,'The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2814,'Which surely he restored to their owner?  My dear fellow, there lies the problem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2815,'It is true that ‘For Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2816,'Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2817,'’ are legible upon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2818,'What, then, did Peterson do?  He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2819,'The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2820,'Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2821,'Did he not advertise?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2822,'Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?  Only as much as we can deduce.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2823,'From his hat?  Precisely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2824,'But you are joking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2825,'What can you gather from this old battered felt?  Here is my lens. You know my methods.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2826,'What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?  I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2827,'It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard, and much the worse for wear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2828,'The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discolored.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2829,'There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials H. B.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2830,'were scrawled upon one side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2831,'It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2832,'For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discolored patches by smearing them with ink.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2833,'I can see nothing, said I, handing it back to my friend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2834,'On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2835,'You fail, however, to reason from what you see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2836,'You are too timid in drawing your inferences.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2837,'Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?  He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2838,'It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been, he remarked, and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2839,'That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2840,'He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2841,'This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2842,'My dear Holmes!  He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect, he continued, disregarding my remonstrance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2843,'He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2844,'These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2845,'Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2846,'You are certainly joking, Holmes.  Not in the least.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2847,'Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?  I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am unable to follow you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2848,'For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?  For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2849,'It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2850,'It is a question of cubic capacity, said he; a man with so large a brain must have something in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2851,'The decline of his fortunes, then?  This hat is three years old.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2852,'These flat brims curled at the edge came in then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2853,'It is a hat of the very best quality.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2854,'Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2855,'If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2856,'Well, that is clear enough, certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2857,'But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?  Sherlock Holmes laughed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2858,'Here is the foresight, said he, putting his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2859,'They are never sold upon hats.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2860,'If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2861,'But since we see that he has broken the elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2862,'On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2863,'Your reasoning is certainly plausible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2864,'The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2865,'The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2866,'They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odor of lime-cream.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2867,'This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the best of training.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2868,'But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2869,'This hat has not been brushed for weeks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2870,'When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2871,'But he might be a bachelor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2872,'Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2873,'Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2874,'You have an answer to everything.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2875,'But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?  One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2876,'Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2877,'Are you satisfied?  Well, it is very ingenious, said I, laughing; but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2878,'Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.  The goose, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2879,'Holmes! The goose, sir! he gasped.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2880,'Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window? Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s excited face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2881,'See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop! He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2882,'Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2883,'By Jove, Peterson! said he, this is treasure trove indeed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2884,'I suppose you know what you have got?  A diamond, sir? A precious stone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2885,'It cuts into glass as though it were putty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2886,'It’s more than a precious stone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2887,'It is _the_ precious stone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2888,'Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle! I ejaculated.  Precisely so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2889,'I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2890,'It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of £1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2891,'A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy! The commissionaire plumped down into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2892,'That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2893,'It was lost, if I remember aright, at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan,’ I remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2894,'Precisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2895,'John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2896,'The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2897,'I have some account of the matter here, I believe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2898,'He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:  ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2899,'John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2900,'abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2901,'James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2902,'He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2903,'On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2904,'Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2905,'Catherine Cusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2906,'Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2907,'Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2908,'Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion, and was carried out of court.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2909,'’  Hum! So much for the police-court, said Holmes, thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2910,'The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2911,'You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2912,'Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2913,'Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2914,'So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2915,'To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2916,'If this fails, I shall have recourse to other methods.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2917,'What will you say?  Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2918,'Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2919,'Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2920,'30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2921,'’ That is clear and concise.  Very.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2922,'But will he see it?  Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2923,'He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson, that he thought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2924,'Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one who knows him will direct his attention to it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2925,'Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2926,'In which, sir?  Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2927,'James’s_, _Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.  Very well, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2928,'And this stone?  Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2929,'And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2930,'When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2931,'It’s a bonny thing, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2932,'Just see how it glints and sparkles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2933,'Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2934,'They are the devil’s pet baits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2935,'In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2936,'This stone is not yet twenty years old.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2937,'It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in Southern China, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2938,'In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2939,'There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2940,'Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2941,'Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?  I cannot tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2942,'Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?  It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2943,'That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer to our advertisement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2944,'And you can do nothing until then?  Nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2945,'In that case I shall continue my professional round.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2946,'But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2947,'Very glad to see you. I dine at seven.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2948,'There is a woodcock, I believe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2949,'By-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2950,'Hudson to examine its crop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2951,'I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2952,'As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2953,'Just as I arrived, the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’s room.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2954,'Henry Baker, I believe, said he, rising from his arm-chair, and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2955,'Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2956,'It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2957,'Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2958,'Is that your hat, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2959,'Baker?  Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2960,'He was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2961,'A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’s surmise as to his habits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2962,'His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2963,'He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2964,'We have retained these things for some days, said Holmes, because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2965,'I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2966,'Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2967,'Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were, he remarked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2968,'I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2969,'I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.  Very naturally.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2970,'By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2971,'To eat it! Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2972,'Yes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2973,'But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?  Oh, certainly, certainly; answered Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2974,'Baker, with a sigh of relief.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2975,'Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—  The man burst into a hearty laugh.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2976,'They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure, said he, but beyond that I can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2977,'No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2979,'There is your hat, then, and there your bird, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2980,'By-the-way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2981,'Certainly, sir, said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained property under his arm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2982,'There are a few of us who frequent the ‘Alpha Inn,’ near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2983,'This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2984,'My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2985,'I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2986,'With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.  So much for Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2987,'Henry Baker, said Holmes, when he had closed the door behind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2988,'It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2989,'Are you hungry, Watson?  Not particularly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2990,'Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up this clew while it is still hot.  By all means.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2991,'It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2992,'Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2993,'Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the Doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2997,'My geese! The man seemed surprised.  Yes.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(2999,'Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.  Ah! yes, I see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3000,'But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3001,'Indeed! Whose, then?  Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3002,'Indeed? I know some of them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3003,'Which was it?  Breckinridge is his name.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3004,'Ah! I don’t know him.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3006,'Good-night?  Now for Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3007,'Breckinridge, he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we came out into the frosty air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3008,'Remember, Watson, that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3009,'It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3010,'Let us follow it out to the bitter end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3011,'Faces to the south, then, and quick march!  We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3012,'One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up the shutters.  Good-evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3013,'It’s a cold night, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3014,'The salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3015,'Sold out of geese, I see, continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3016,'Let you have 500 to-morrow morning.  That’s no good.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3017,'Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3018,'Ah, but I was recommended to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3019,'Who by?  The landlord of the ‘Alpha.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3020,'’  Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3021,'Fine birds they were, too.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3022,'Now where did you get them from?  To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3023,'Now, then, mister, said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3024,'It is straight enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3025,'I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the ‘Alpha.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3026,'’  Well, then, I sha’n’t tell you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3027,'So now!  Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3028,'Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3029,'When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3030,'Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries, said Holmes, carelessly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3031,'If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3032,'But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3033,'Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred, snapped the salesman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3034,'It’s nothing of the kind.  I say it is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3035,'I don’t believe it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3036,'D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the ‘Alpha’ were town bred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3037,'You’ll never persuade me to believe that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3038,'Will you bet, then?  It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3039,'But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3040,'The salesman chuckled grimly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3041,'Bring me the books, Bill, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3042,'The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.  Now then, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3043,'Cocksure, said the salesman, I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3044,'You see this little book?  Well?  That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3045,'D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3046,'Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3047,'Now, look at that third name.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3048,'Just read it out to me.  Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3049,'Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249, read Holmes.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3050,'Now turn that up in the ledger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3051,'Holmes turned to the page indicated. Here you are, ‘Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3052,'Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3053,'’  Now, then, what’s the last entry?  ‘December 22.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3054,'Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._’  Quite so. There you are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3055,'And underneath?  ‘Sold to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3056,'Windigate of the ‘Alpha,’ at 12_s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3057,'_’  What have you to say now?  Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3058,'He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3059,'A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3060,'When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘pink ‘un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3061,'I dare say that if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3062,'Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3063,'Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3064,'It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—  His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3065,'Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3066,'I’ve had enough of you and your geese, he shouted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3067,'I wish you were all at the devil together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3068,'If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3069,'Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?  No; but one of them was mine all the same, whined the little man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3070,'Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3071,'She told me to ask you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3072,'Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3073,'I’ve had enough of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3074,'Get out of this! He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3075,'Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road, whispered Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3076,'Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3077,'Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3078,'He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight that every vestige of color had been driven from his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3079,'Who are you, then? What do you want? he asked, in a quavering voice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3080,'You will excuse me, said Holmes, blandly, but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3081,'I think that I could be of assistance to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3082,'You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?  My name is Sherlock Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3083,'It is my business to know what other people don’t know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3084,'But you can know nothing of this?  Excuse me, I know everything of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3085,'You are endeavoring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3086,'Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3087,'Windigate, of the ‘Alpha,’ and by him to his club, of which Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3088,'Henry Baker is a member.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3089,'Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet, cried the little fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3090,'I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3091,'Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3092,'In that case we had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept market-place, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3093,'But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3094,'The man hesitated for an instant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3095,'My name is John Robinson, he answered, with a sidelong glance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3096,'No, no; the real name, said Holmes, sweetly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3097,'It is always awkward doing business with an _alias_.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3098,'A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3099,'Well, then, said he, my real name is James Ryder.  Precisely so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3100,'Head attendant at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3101,'’ Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3102,'The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3103,'Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3104,'Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3105,'Here we are! said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3106,'The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3107,'Pray take the basket-chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3108,'I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3109,'Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3110,'Or rather, I fancy, of that goose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3111,'It was one bird, I imagine, in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3112,'Ryder quivered with emotion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3113,'Oh, sir, he cried, can you tell me where it went to?  It came here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3114,'Here?  Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3115,'I don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3116,'It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3117,'I have it here in my museum.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3118,'Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with his right hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3119,'Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3120,'Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3121,'The game’s up, Ryder, said Holmes, quietly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3122,'Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3123,'He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3124,'Give him a dash of brandy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3125,'So! Now he looks a little more human.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3126,'What a shrimp it is, to be sure!  For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3127,'I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3128,'Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3129,'You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?  It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it, said he, in a crackling voice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3130,'I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3131,'Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3132,'It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3133,'You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3134,'What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3135,'Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3136,'You then—  Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3137,'For God’s sake, have mercy! he shrieked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3138,'Think of my father! of my mother! It would break their hearts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3139,'I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3140,'I’ll swear it on a Bible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3141,'Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!  Get back into your chair! said Holmes, sternly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3142,'It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.  I will fly, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3143,'I will leave the country, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3144,'Then the charge against him will break down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3145,'Hum! We will talk about that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3146,'And now let us hear a true account of the next act.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3147,'How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3148,'[Illustration: ‘HAVE MERCY!’ HE SHRIEKED]  Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3149,'I will tell you it just as it happened, sir, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3150,'When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3151,'There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3152,'I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3153,'She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3154,'All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3155,'My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3156,'Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3157,'I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3158,'One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3159,'I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3160,'He would show me how to turn the stone into money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3161,'But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3162,'I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3163,'I was leaning against the wall at the time, and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3164,'My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3165,'I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3166,'There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3167,'I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3168,'The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3169,'But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3170,'As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3171,'‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3172,'‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3173,'’  ‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3174,'It’s the big white one over yonder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3175,'There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3176,'’  ‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3177,'’  ‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’  ‘Never mind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3178,'I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3179,'‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3180,'‘Which is it you want, then?’  ‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’  ‘Oh, very well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3181,'Kill it and take it with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3182,'’  Well, I did what she said, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3183,'Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3184,'I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3185,'He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3186,'My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3187,'I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3188,'There was not a bird to be seen there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3189,'‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3190,'‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3191,'’  ‘Which dealer’s?’  ‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3192,'’  ‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’  ‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3193,'’  Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3194,'You heard him yourselves to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3195,'Well, he has always answered me like that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3196,'My sister thinks that I am going mad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3197,'Sometimes I think that I am myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3198,'And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3199,'God help me! God help me! He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3200,'There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’s finger-tips upon the edge of the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3201,'Then my friend rose and threw open the door.  Get out! said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3202,'What, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!  No more words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3203,'Get out!  And no more words were needed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3204,'There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3205,'After all, Watson, said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3206,'If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3207,'I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3208,'This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3209,'Send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3210,'Besides, it is the season of forgiveness.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3213,'Adventure VIII  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND   On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3214,'Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3215,'The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3216,'It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3219,'It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3220,'He was a late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3221,'Very sorry to knock you up, Watson, said he, but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3222,'Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3241,'What, then?  It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3242,'She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3243,'Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her expression was weary and haggard.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3263,'Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3266,'Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3267,'I think it was before your time, Watson.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3270,'And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3271,'Alas! replied our visitor, the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3272,'He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3283,'The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my step-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3284,'In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3293,'The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3294,'But a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3295,'Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3296,'Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3297,'A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3298,'Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3299,'He had no friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3304,'Your sister is dead, then?  She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3305,'You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3325,'I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3326,'I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3327,'I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’  ‘No, I have not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3328,'It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’  ‘Very likely.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3333,'Indeed, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3334,'Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?  Always.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3335,'And why?  I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3336,'We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.  Quite so.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3339,'A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3340,'My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3341,'The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3342,'Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3343,'I knew that it was my sister’s voice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3344,'I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3345,'As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3346,'As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3347,'I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3348,'By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3349,'I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3350,'She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3351,'At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3352,'I rushed out, calling loudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3353,'When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3354,'Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3355,'One moment, said Holmes; are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?  That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3356,'It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3357,'Was your sister dressed?  No, she was in her night-dress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3358,'In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3359,'Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3360,'And what conclusions did the coroner come to?  He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3361,'Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3362,'My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3363,'The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3364,'The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3365,'It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3366,'Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3367,'How about poison?  The doctors examined her for it, but without success.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3368,'What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?  It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3369,'Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?  Yes, there are nearly always some there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3370,'Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?  Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gypsies in the plantation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3371,'I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3372,'Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3373,'These are very deep waters, said he; pray go on with your narrative.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3374,'Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3375,'A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3378,'My step-father has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3379,'Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3380,'Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3381,'I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3382,'I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3383,'You have done wisely, said my friend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3384,'But have you told me all?  Yes, all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3385,'Miss Roylott, you have not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3386,'You are screening your step-father.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3387,'Why, what do you mean?  For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3388,'Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3389,'You have been cruelly used, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3390,'The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3391,'He is a hard man, she said, and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3392,'There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3393,'This is a very deep business, he said, at last.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3394,'There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3395,'Yet we have not a moment to lose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3396,'If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your step-father?  As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3397,'It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3398,'We have a house-keeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.  Excellent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3399,'You are not averse to this trip, Watson?  By no means.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3400,'Then we shall both come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3401,'What are you going to do yourself?  I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3402,'But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3403,'And you may expect us early in the afternoon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3404,'I have myself some small business matters to attend to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3405,'Will you not wait and breakfast?  No, I must go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3406,'My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3407,'I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3408,'She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3409,'And what do you think of it all, Watson? asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3410,'It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3411,'Dark enough and sinister enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3412,'Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3413,'What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?  I cannot think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3414,'When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars which secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3415,'But what, then, did the gypsies do?  I cannot imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3416,'I see many objections to any such theory.  And so do I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3417,'It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3418,'I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3419,'But what in the name of the devil!  The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3420,'His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3421,'So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3422,'A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3423,'Which of you is Holmes? asked this apparition.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3424,'My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me, said my companion, quietly.  I am Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3425,'Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3426,'Indeed, doctor, said Holmes, blandly. Pray take a seat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3427,'I will do nothing of the kind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3428,'My step-daughter has been here. I have traced her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3429,'What has she been saying to you?  It is a little cold for the time of the year, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3430,'What has she been saying to you? screamed the old man, furiously.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3431,'But I have heard that the crocuses promise well, continued my companion, imperturbably.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3432,'Ha! You put me off, do you? said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3433,'I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3434,'You are Holmes, the meddler.  My friend smiled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3435,'Holmes, the busybody!  His smile broadened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3436,'Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!  Holmes chuckled heartily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3437,'Your conversation is most entertaining, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3438,'When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3439,'I will go when I have said my say.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3440,'Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3441,'I know that Miss Stoner has been here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3442,'I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3443,'He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3444,'See that you keep yourself out of my grip, he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3445,'He seems a very amiable person, said Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3446,'I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3447,'As he spoke he picked up the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3448,'Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3449,'And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3450,'*       *       *       *       *  It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3451,'He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3452,'I have seen the will of the deceased wife, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3453,'To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3454,'The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3455,'Each daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3456,'It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3457,'My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3458,'And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3459,'I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3460,'2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3461,'That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3462,'At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3463,'It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3464,'The trees and way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3465,'To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3466,'My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3467,'Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3468,'Look there! said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3469,'A heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3470,'From amid the branches there jutted out the gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3471,'Stoke Moran? said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3472,'Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3473,'Grimesby Roylott, remarked the driver.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3474,'There is some building going on there, said Holmes; that is where we are going.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3475,'There’s the village, said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3476,'There it is, where the lady is walking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3477,'And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner, observed Holmes, shading his eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3478,'Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3479,'We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3480,'I thought it as well, said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3481,'It may stop his gossip.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3482,'Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3483,'You see that we have been as good as our word.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3484,'Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3485,'I have been waiting so eagerly for you, she cried, shaking hands with us warmly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3486,'All has turned out splendidly. Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3487,'Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3488,'We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance, said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3489,'Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3490,'Good heavens! she cried, he has followed me, then.  So it appears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3491,'He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3492,'What will he say when he returns?  He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more cunning than himself upon his track.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3493,'You must lock yourself up from him to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3494,'If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at Harrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3495,'Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3496,'The building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3497,'In one of these wings the windows were broken, and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3498,'The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3499,'Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3500,'Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3501,'This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3502,'Roylott’s chamber?  Exactly so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3503,'But I am now sleeping in the middle one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3504,'Pending the alterations, as I understand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3505,'By-the-way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.  There were none.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3506,'I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3507,'Ah! that is suggestive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3508,'Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3509,'There are windows in it, of course?  Yes, but very small ones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3510,'Too narrow for any one to pass through.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3511,'As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3512,'Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3513,'Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3514,'There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3515,'Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3516,'Hum! said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; my theory certainly presents some difficulties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3517,'No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3518,'Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3519,'A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3520,'Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3521,'It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3522,'A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3523,'These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3524,'The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3525,'Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3526,'Where does that bell communicate with? he asked, at last, pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3527,'It goes to the house-keeper’s room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3528,'It looks newer than the other things?  Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3529,'Your sister asked for it, I suppose?  No, I never heard of her using it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3530,'We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3531,'Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3532,'You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3533,'He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand, and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3534,'Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3535,'Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the wall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3536,'Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3537,'Why, it’s a dummy, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3538,'Won’t it ring?  No, it is not even attached to a wire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3539,'This is very interesting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3540,'You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3541,'How very absurd! I never noticed that before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3542,'Very strange! muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3543,'There are one or two very singular points about this room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3544,'For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!  That is also quite modern, said the lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3545,'Done about the same time as the bell-rope? remarked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3546,'Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3547,'They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3548,'With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.  Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3549,'Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3550,'A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3551,'Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3552,'What’s in here? he asked, tapping the safe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3553,'My step-father’s business papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3554,'Oh! you have seen inside, then?  Only once, some years ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3555,'I remember that it was full of papers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3556,'There isn’t a cat in it, for example?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3557,'What a strange idea!  Well, look at this! He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3558,'No; we don’t keep a cat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3559,'But there is a cheetah and a baboon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3560,'Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare say.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3561,'There is one point which I should wish to determine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3562,'He squatted down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.  Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3563,'That is quite settled, said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3564,'Hello! Here is something interesting!  The object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one corner of the bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3565,'The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied so as to make a loop of whip-cord.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3566,'What do you make of that, Watson?  It’s a common enough lash.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3567,'But I don’t know why it should be tied.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3568,'That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3569,'I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3570,'I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3571,'We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3572,'It is very essential, Miss Stoner, said he, that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3573,'I shall most certainly do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3574,'The matter is too serious for any hesitation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3575,'Your life may depend upon your compliance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3576,'I assure you that I am in your hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3577,'In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3578,'Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3579,'Yes, it must be so. Let me explain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3580,'I believe that that is the village inn over there?  Yes, that is the ‘Crown.’  Very good.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3581,'Your windows would be visible from there?  Certainly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3582,'You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your step-father comes back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3583,'Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3584,'I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.  Oh yes, easily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3585,'The rest you will leave in our hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3586,'But what will you do?  We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.  I believe, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3587,'Holmes, that you have already made up your mind, said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.  Perhaps I have.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3588,'Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3589,'I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3590,'You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3591,'[Illustration: ‘GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE’]  No, I do not think so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3592,'I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3593,'And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3594,'Roylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3595,'Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3596,'Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3597,'They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3598,'Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3599,'The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3600,'The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3601,'Do you know, Watson, said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering darkness, I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3602,'There is a distinct element of danger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3603,'Can I be of assistance?  Your presence might be invaluable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3604,'Then I shall certainly come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3605,'It is very kind of you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3606,'You speak of danger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3607,'You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3608,'No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3609,'I imagine that you saw all that I did.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3610,'I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3611,'You saw the ventilator, too?  Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3612,'It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3613,'I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3614,'My dear Holmes!  Oh yes, I did.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3615,'You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3616,'Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3617,'It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3618,'I deduced a ventilator.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3619,'But what harm can there be in that?  Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3620,'A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3621,'Does not that strike you?  I cannot as yet see any connection.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3622,'Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3623,'It was clamped to the floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3624,'Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?  I cannot say that I have.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3625,'The lady could not move her bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3626,'It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3627,'Holmes, I cried, I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3628,'We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3629,'Subtle enough and horrible enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3630,'When a doctor does go wrong, he is the first of criminals.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3631,'He has nerve and he has knowledge.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3632,'Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3633,'This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3634,'But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3635,'*       *       *       *       *  About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3636,'Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3637,'That is our signal, said Holmes, springing to his feet; it comes from the middle window.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3638,'As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3639,'A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3640,'There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3641,'Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3642,'My God! I whispered; did you see it?  Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3643,'His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3644,'Then he broke into a low laugh, and put his lips to my ear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3645,'It is a nice household, he murmured. That is the baboon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3646,'I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3647,'There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3648,'I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3649,'My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3650,'All was as we had seen it in the daytime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3651,'Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  The least sound would be fatal to our plans.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3652,'I nodded to show that I had heard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3653,'We must sit without light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3654,'He would see it through the ventilator.  I nodded again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3655,'Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3656,'Have your pistol ready in case we should need it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3657,'I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3658,'I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3659,'Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3660,'By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3661,'Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3662,'How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3663,'The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3664,'From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3665,'Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3666,'How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3667,'Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3668,'Some one in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3669,'I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3670,'For half an hour I sat with straining ears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3671,'Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3672,'The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3673,'You see it, Watson? he yelled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3674,'You see it?  But I saw nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3675,'At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3676,'I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and filled with horror and loathing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3677,'He had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3678,'It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3679,'They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3680,'It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3681,'What can it mean? I gasped.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3682,'It means that it is all over, Holmes answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3683,'And perhaps, after all, it is for the best.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3684,'Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3685,'With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3686,'Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3687,'Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3688,'It was a singular sight which met our eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3689,'On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3690,'Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3691,'Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3692,'Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3693,'His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3694,'Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3695,'As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3696,'The band! the speckled band! whispered Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3697,'I took a step forward.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3698,'In an instant his strange head-gear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3699,'It is a swamp adder! cried Holmes; the deadliest snake in India.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3700,'He has died within ten seconds of being bitten.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3701,'Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3702,'Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the county police know what has happened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3703,'As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid perch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3704,'*       *       *       *       *  Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3706,'It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3707,'The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3708,'I had, said he, come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3709,'The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3710,'I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3711,'My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3712,'The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming to the bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3713,'The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3714,'The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3715,'The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3716,'It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3717,'Then I thought of the whistle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3718,'Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3719,'He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3720,'He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3721,'It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3722,'I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3723,'An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3724,'The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3725,'The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3726,'Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3727,'I heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3728,'With the result of driving it through the ventilator.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3729,'And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3730,'Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3731,'In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3735,'Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3736,'Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3737,'The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3738,'At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3739,'It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarize.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3740,'I had returned to civil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even persuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3741,'My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3742,'One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and of endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3743,'One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come from Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3744,'I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened down-stairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3745,'As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3746,'I’ve got him here, he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; he’s all right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3747,'What is it, then? I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3748,'It’s a new patient, he whispered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3749,'I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3750,'There he is, all safe and sound.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3751,'I must go now, doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3752,'And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3753,'I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3754,'He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft cloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3755,'Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with blood-stains.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3756,'He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3757,'I am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor, said he, but I have had a very serious accident during the night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3758,'I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3759,'I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3760,'I took it up and glanced at it. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3761,'Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d floor).');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3763,'I regret that I have kept you waiting, said I, sitting down in my library-chair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3764,'You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3765,'Oh, my night could not be called monotonous, said he, and laughed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3766,'He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3767,'All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3768,'Stop it! I cried; pull yourself together! and I poured out some water from a caraffe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3769,'It was useless, however.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3770,'He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3771,'Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and blushing hotly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3772,'I have been making a fool of myself, he gasped.  Not at all. Drink this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3773,'I dashed some brandy into the water, and the color began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3774,'That’s better! said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3775,'And now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3776,'He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3777,'It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3778,'There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3779,'It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3780,'Good heavens! I cried, this is a terrible injury.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3781,'It must have bled considerably.  Yes, it did.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3782,'I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3783,'When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3784,'Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3785,'It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3786,'This has been done, said I, examining the wound, by a very heavy and sharp instrument.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3787,'A thing like a cleaver, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3788,'An accident, I presume?  By no means.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3789,'What! a murderous attack?  Very murderous indeed.  You horrify me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3790,'I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3791,'He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3792,'How is that? I asked, when I had finished.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3793,'Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3794,'I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3795,'Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3796,'It is evidently trying to your nerves.  Oh no, not now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3797,'I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3798,'Ha! cried I, if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3799,'Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3800,'Oh, I have heard of that fellow, answered my visitor, and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3801,'Would you give me an introduction to him?  I’ll do better.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3802,'I’ll take you round to him myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3803,'I should be immensely obliged to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3804,'We’ll call a cab and go together.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3806,'Do you feel equal to it?  Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3807,'Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3808,'I rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3809,'Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_, and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantel-piece.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3810,'He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3811,'When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy-and-water within his reach.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3812,'It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3813,'Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3815,'Thank you, said my patient, but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3816,'I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3817,'Holmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3819,'By profession I am an hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3820,'Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself, and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3821,'I suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3822,'To me it has been exceptionally so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3823,'During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3828,'Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3829,'I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3830,'His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3831,'Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3832,'He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.  ‘Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3833,'Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3888,'These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3889,'Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3890,'I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighboring fields.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3891,'This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3892,'This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3893,'We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3894,'That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3895,'I hope that I make it all plain?’  ‘I quite follow you,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3896,'‘The only point which I could not quite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3897,'’  ‘Ah!’ said he, carelessly, ‘we have our own process.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3898,'We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3899,'But that is a mere detail.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3900,'I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3901,'Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3902,'’ He rose as he spoke.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3903,'‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3904,'’  ‘I shall certainly be there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3905,'’  ‘And not a word to a soul.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3906,'’ He looked at me with a last, long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3907,'Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3908,'On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3909,'On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell any one of my errand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3910,'However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3911,'[Illustration: ‘NOT A WORD TO A SOUL’]  At Reading I had to change not only my carriage, but my station.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3912,'However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3913,'I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3914,'As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3915,'Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3916,'He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3917,'One horse? interjected Holmes.  Yes, only one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3918,'Did you observe the color?  Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3919,'Tired-looking or fresh?  Oh, fresh and glossy.  Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3920,'I am sorry to have interrupted you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3921,'Pray continue your most interesting statement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3922,'Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3923,'Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3924,'He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3925,'The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3926,'I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3927,'Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3928,'At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3929,'Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3930,'We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3931,'The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3932,'It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches, and muttering under his breath.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3933,'Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3934,'It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3935,'I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3936,'She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3937,'Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3938,'‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3939,'It was a quiet, little, plainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3940,'Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3941,'‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3942,'I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3943,'Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3944,'It was a wonderfully silent house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3945,'There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3946,'A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3947,'Who were these German people, and what were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3948,'For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3949,'Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3950,'I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3951,'Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3952,'The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3953,'I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3954,'She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3955,'‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3956,'I should not stay here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3957,'There is no good for you to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3958,'’  ‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3959,'I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3960,'’  ‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3961,'‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3962,'’ And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3963,'‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’  But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3964,'I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3965,'Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3966,'With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and declared my intention of remaining where I was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3967,'She was about to renew her entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps were heard upon the stairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3968,'She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3969,'The new-comers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3970,'‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3971,'‘By-the-way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3972,'I fear that you have felt the draught.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3973,'’  ‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself, because I felt the room to be a little close.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3974,'’  He shot one of his suspicious looks at me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3975,'‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3976,'Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3977,'’  ‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3978,'’  ‘Oh no, it is in the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3979,'’  ‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’  ‘No, no.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3980,'This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3981,'All we wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is wrong with it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3982,'’  We went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager, and I behind him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3983,'It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3984,'There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3985,'I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3986,'Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3987,'Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3988,'Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3989,'Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3990,'‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to turn it on.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3991,'The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3992,'There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3993,'The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3994,'Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3995,'’  I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3996,'It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3997,'When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3998,'An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(3999,'This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4000,'When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4001,'It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4002,'The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4003,'I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I heard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4004,'‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4005,'I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4006,'‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4007,'’  The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4008,'His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4009,'‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4010,'’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4011,'I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hello!’ I yelled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4012,'‘Hello! Colonel! Let me out!’  And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4013,'It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4014,'He had set the engine at work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4015,'The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4016,'By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4017,'I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4018,'I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4019,'The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4020,'Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4021,'If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4022,'Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4023,'I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4024,'As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4025,'For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4026,'The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4027,'The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4028,'I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4029,'It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4030,'‘Come! come!’ she cried, breathlessly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4031,'‘They will be here in a moment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4032,'They will see that you are not there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4033,'Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’  This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4034,'I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4035,'The latter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4036,'My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits’ end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4037,'Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4038,'‘It is your only chance,’ said she.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4039,'‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4040,'’  As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4041,'I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4042,'How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4043,'I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who pursued me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4044,'If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4045,'The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4046,'‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried, in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4047,'You said it should not be again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4048,'He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’  ‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4049,'‘You will be the ruin of us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4050,'He has seen too much.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4051,'Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4052,'I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4053,'I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4054,'I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4055,'Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4056,'I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4057,'I endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4058,'How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4059,'It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4060,'My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4061,'The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4062,'But, to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4063,'I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4064,'Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4065,'Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4066,'There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4067,'The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4068,'I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4069,'The name was strange to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4070,'Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4071,'Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4072,'It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4073,'I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4074,'It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4075,'I put the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4076,'We both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this extraordinary narrative.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4077,'Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4078,'Here is an advertisement which will interest you, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4079,'It appeared in all the papers about a year ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4080,'Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4081,'Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic engineer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4082,'Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4083,'Was dressed in,’ etc., etc.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4084,'Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4085,'Good heavens! cried my patient.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4086,'Then that explains what the girl said.  Undoubtedly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4087,'It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4088,'Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4089,'Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4090,'There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4091,'Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4092,'There you are, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4093,'That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4094,'The place we want must be somewhere near that line.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4095,'You said ten miles, I think, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4096,'It was an hour’s good drive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4097,'And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?  They must have done so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4098,'I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4099,'What I cannot understand, said I, is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4100,'Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4101,'I hardly think that likely.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4105,'I think I could lay my finger on it, said Holmes, quietly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4106,'Really, now! cried the inspector, you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4107,'I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4108,'And I say east, said my patient.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4109,'I am for west, remarked the plain-clothes man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4110,'There are several quiet little villages up there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4111,'And I am for north, said I, because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4112,'Come, cried the inspector, laughing; it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4113,'We have boxed the compass among us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4114,'Who do you give your casting vote to?  You are all wrong.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4115,'But we can’t _all_ be.  Oh yes, you can.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4116,'This is my point; he placed his finger in the centre of the circle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4117,'This is where we shall find them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4118,'But the twelve-mile drive? gasped Hatherley.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4119,'Six out and six back. Nothing simpler.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4120,'You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4121,'How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?  Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough, observed Bradstreet, thoughtfully.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4122,'Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4123,'None at all, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4124,'They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4125,'We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work, said the inspector.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4126,'They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4127,'We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4128,'But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4129,'But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4130,'As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4131,'A house on fire? asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on its way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4132,'Yes, sir! said the station-master.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4133,'When did it break out?  I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4134,'Whose house is it?  Dr. Becher’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4135,'Tell me, broke in the engineer, is Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4136,'Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?  The station-master laughed heartily. No, sir, Dr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4137,'Becher is an Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4138,'But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4139,'The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4140,'The road topped a low hill, and there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4141,'That’s it! cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4142,'There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4143,'That second window is the one that I jumped from.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4144,'Well, at least, said Holmes, you have had your revenge upon them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4145,'There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4146,'Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4147,'And Holmes’s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4148,'Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’s ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clew as to their whereabouts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4149,'The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4150,'About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4151,'Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4152,'How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4153,'He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4154,'On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4155,'Well, said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once more to London, it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?  Experience, said Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4156,'Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4159,'Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4160,'As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4161,'It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4162,'I had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign, throbbed with dull persistency.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4163,'With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers, until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4164,'Here is a very fashionable epistle, I remarked, as he entered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4165,'Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4166,'Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety, he answered, smiling, and the humbler are usually the more interesting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4167,'This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4168,'He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4169,'Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4170,'Not social, then?  No, distinctly professional.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4171,'And from a noble client?  One of the highest in England.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4173,'I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4174,'It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4175,'You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?  It looks like it, said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4176,'I have had nothing else to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4177,'It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4178,'I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4179,'The latter is always instructive.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4215,'Terse and to the point, remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4216,'There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4218,'One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4219,'An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4220,'Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4221,'Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4223,'Simon has no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4224,'’  Anything else? asked Holmes, yawning.  Oh yes; plenty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4225,'Then there is another note in _The Morning Post_ to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4230,'The vanishing of the lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4231,'When did she vanish, then?  At the wedding breakfast.  Indeed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4232,'This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4233,'Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4234,'They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honey-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4235,'Pray let me have the details.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4236,'I warn you that they are very incomplete.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4237,'Perhaps we may make them less so.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4249,'It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4250,'It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4251,'The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4256,'Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4257,'There are rumors of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4258,'’  And is that all?  Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4259,'And it is—  That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4260,'It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_ at the ‘Allegro,’ and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4261,'There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4262,'And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4264,'But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4265,'Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.  Lord Robert St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4266,'Simon, announced our page-boy, throwing open the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4267,'A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4268,'His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4269,'His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4270,'As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored gaiters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4271,'He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eye-glasses.  Good-day, Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4272,'Simon, said Holmes, rising and bowing.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4276,'A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4277,'I have been cut to the quick.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4278,'I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4279,'No, I am descending.  I beg pardon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4280,'My last client of the sort was a king.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4281,'Oh, really! I had no idea.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4282,'And which king?  The King of Scandinavia.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4283,'What! Had he lost his wife?  You can understand, said Holmes, suavely, that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4284,'Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4285,'As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.  Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4286,'I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4287,'I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.  Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4288,'Simon glanced over it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4289,'Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4290,'But it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer an opinion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4291,'I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.  Pray do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4292,'When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?  In San Francisco, a year ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4293,'You were travelling in the States?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4294,'Did you become engaged then?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4295,'But you were on a friendly footing?  I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4296,'Her father is very rich?  He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4297,'And how did he make his money?  In mining.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4298,'He had nothing a few years ago.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4299,'Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4300,'Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?  The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. You see, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4301,'Holmes, said he, my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4302,'During that time she ran free in a mining camp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the school-master.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4303,'She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4304,'She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4305,'She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless in carrying out her resolutions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4306,'On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honor to bear—he gave a little stately cough—had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4307,'I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything dishonorable would be repugnant to her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4308,'Have you her photograph?  I brought this with me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4309,'He opened a locket, and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4310,'It was not a photograph, but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4311,'Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4312,'Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4313,'The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?  Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4314,'I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4315,'She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?  A fair dowry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4316,'Not more than is usual in my family.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4317,'And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait accompli_?  I really have made no inquiries on the subject.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4318,'Very naturally not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4319,'Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4320,'Was she in good spirits?  Never better.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4321,'She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4322,'Indeed! That is very interesting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4323,'And on the morning of the wedding?  She was as bright as possible—at least, until after the ceremony.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4324,'And did you observe any change in her then?  Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4325,'The incident, however, was too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4326,'Pray let us have it, for all that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4327,'Oh, it is childish.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4328,'She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4329,'She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4330,'There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4331,'Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4332,'Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4333,'Some of the general public were present, then?  Oh yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4334,'It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4335,'This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?  No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4336,'I hardly noticed his appearance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4337,'But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.  Lady St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4338,'Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4339,'What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?  I saw her in conversation with her maid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4340,'And who is her maid?  Alice is her name.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4341,'She is an American, and came from California with her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4342,'A confidential servant?  A little too much so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4343,'It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4344,'Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4345,'How long did she speak to this Alice?  Oh, a few minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4346,'I had something else to think of.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4347,'You did not overhear what they said?  Lady St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4348,'Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4349,'’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4350,'I have no idea what she meant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4351,'American slang is very expressive sometimes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4352,'And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?  She walked into the breakfast-room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4353,'On your arm?  No, alone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4354,'She was very independent in little matters like that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4355,'Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4356,'But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4357,'And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4358,'Doran’s house that morning.  Ah, yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4359,'I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.  Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4360,'Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4361,'We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_ friendly footing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4362,'She used to be at the ‘Allegro.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4363,'’ I have not treated her ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me; but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4364,'Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4365,'She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4366,'Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4367,'She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4368,'Did your wife hear all this?  No, thank goodness, she did not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4369,'And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?  Yes. That is what Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4370,'Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4371,'It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some terrible trap for her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4372,'Well, it is a possible supposition.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4373,'You think so, too?  I did not say a probable one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4374,'But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?  I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4375,'Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4376,'Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?  Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4377,'I have given you all the facts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4378,'Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4379,'In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?  Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4380,'Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis, said Holmes, smiling. And now, Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4381,'Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4382,'May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?  We could see the other side of the road and the Park.  Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4383,'Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4384,'I shall communicate with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4385,'Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem, said our client, rising.  I have solved it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4386,'Eh? What was that?  I say that I have solved it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4387,'Where, then, is my wife?  That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.  Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4388,'Simon shook his head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4389,'I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine, he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner, he departed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4390,'It is very good of Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4391,'Simon to honor my head by putting it on a level with his own, said Sherlock Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4392,'I think that I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4393,'I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4394,'My dear Holmes!  I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4395,'My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4396,'Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s example.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4397,'But I have heard all that you have heard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4398,'Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4399,'There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian war.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4400,'It is one of these cases—but, hello, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4401,'The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4402,'With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4403,'What’s up, then? asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4404,'You look dissatisfied.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4405,'And I feel dissatisfied.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4406,'It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4407,'I can make neither head nor tail of the business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4408,'Really! You surprise me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4409,'Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clew seems to slip through my fingers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4410,'I have been at work upon it all day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4411,'And very wet it seems to have made you, said Holmes, laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4412,'Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4413,'In Heaven’s name, what for?  In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4414,'Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4415,'Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain? he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4416,'Why? What do you mean?  Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4417,'Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4418,'I suppose you know all about it, he snarled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4419,'Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4420,'Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?  I think it very unlikely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4421,'Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it? He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discolored and soaked in water.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4422,'There, said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4423,'There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4424,'Oh, indeed! said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4425,'You dragged them from the Serpentine?  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4426,'They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4427,'They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4428,'By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the neighborhood of his wardrobe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4429,'And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?  At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4430,'I am afraid that you will find it difficult.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4431,'Are you, indeed, now? cried Lestrade, with some bitterness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4432,'I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4433,'You have made two blunders in as many minutes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4434,'This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4435,'And how?  In the dress is a pocket.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4436,'In the pocket is a card-case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4437,'In the card-case is a note.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4438,'And here is the very note.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4439,'He slapped it down upon the table in front of him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4440,'Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4441,'’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4442,'Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4443,'Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within their reach.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4444,'Very good, Lestrade, said Holmes, laughing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4445,'You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4446,'He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4447,'This is indeed important, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4448,'Ha! you find it so?  Extremely so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4449,'I congratulate you warmly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4450,'Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4451,'Why, he shrieked, you’re looking at the wrong side!  On the contrary, this is the right side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4452,'The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4453,'And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4454,'There’s nothing in it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4455,'I looked at it before, said Lestrade. ‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._ 6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4456,'_’ I see nothing in that.  Very likely not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4457,'It is most important, all the same.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4458,'As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4459,'I’ve wasted time enough, said Lestrade, rising.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4460,'I believe in hard work, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4461,'Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4462,'He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4463,'Just one hint to you, Lestrade, drawled Holmes, before his rival vanished; I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4464,'There is not, and there never has been, any such person.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4465,'Lestrade looked sadly at my companion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4466,'Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4467,'He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose and put on his overcoat.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4468,'There is something in what the fellow says about out-door work, he remarked, so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4469,'It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4470,'This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4471,'There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie, with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4472,'Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4473,'Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4474,'His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4475,'They have laid the supper, then, he said, rubbing his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4476,'You seem to expect company.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4477,'They have laid for five.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4478,'Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4479,'I am surprised that Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4480,'Simon has not already arrived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4481,'Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4482,'It was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4483,'My messenger reached you, then? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4484,'Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4485,'Have you good authority for what you say?  The best possible.  Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4486,'Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4487,'What will the duke say, he murmured, when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?  It is the purest accident.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4488,'I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4489,'Ah, you look on these things from another stand-point.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4490,'I fail to see that any one is to blame.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4491,'I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4492,'Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4493,'It was a slight, sir, a public slight, said Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4494,'Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4495,'You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4496,'I will make no allowance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4497,'I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4498,'I think that I heard a ring, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4499,'Yes, there are steps on the landing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4500,'If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4501,'Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4502,'He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4503,'Simon, said he, allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4504,'The lady, I think, you have already met.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4505,'At the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4506,'The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4507,'It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4508,'You’re angry, Robert, said she.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4509,'Well, I guess you have every cause to be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4510,'Pray make no apology to me, said Lord St. Simon, bitterly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4511,'Oh yes, I know that I have treated you real bad, and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4512,'I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.  Perhaps, Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4513,'Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?  If I may give an opinion, remarked the strange gentleman, we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4514,'For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4515,'He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4516,'Then I’ll tell our story right away, said the lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4517,'Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4518,'We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4519,'The richer pa grew, the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4520,'Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4521,'It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4522,'Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4523,'So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and pledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4524,'‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4525,'The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4526,'After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4527,'I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4528,'Pa thought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4529,'Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4530,'Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4531,'Still, if I had married Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4532,'Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4533,'We can’t command our love, but we can our actions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4534,'I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4535,'But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4536,'I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4537,'I wonder I didn’t drop.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4538,'I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4539,'I didn’t know what to do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4540,'Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4541,'Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4542,'As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4543,'It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4544,'Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4545,'When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4546,'I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4547,'I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4548,'Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4549,'I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4550,'I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4551,'He beckoned to me, and then began walking into the Park.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4552,'I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4553,'Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4554,'Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her, and soon overtook Frank.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4555,'We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4556,'Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4557,'I saw it in a paper, explained the American.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4558,'It gave the name and the church, but not where the lady lived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4559,'Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4560,'It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4561,'So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4562,'It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4563,'Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4564,'Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4565,'Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4579,'*       *       *       *       *  The case has been an interesting one, remarked Holmes, when our visitors had left us, because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4681,'I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4682,'Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4684,'’  Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £1000 notes.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4690,'Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4691,'With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4697,'Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4698,'She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4699,'She is a very pretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4700,'That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4701,'So much for the servants.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4712,'It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4713,'He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4714,'When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4715,'He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4716,'He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to draw him back again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4717,'And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4718,'He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4719,'Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in his eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4720,'So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4721,'And now there is only she to be described.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4722,'She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4723,'She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4724,'She is my right hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4725,'I do not know what I could do without her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4726,'In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4727,'Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4728,'I think that if any one could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—for ever too late!  Now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4729,'Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4730,'When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4731,'Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4732,'Mary and Arthur were much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4733,'‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.  ‘In my own bureau.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4734,'’  ‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night,’ said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4735,'‘It is locked up,’ I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4736,'‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4737,'When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4738,'’  He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4739,'He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4740,'‘Look here, dad,’ said he, with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £200?’  ‘No, I cannot!’ I answered, sharply.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4741,'‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4742,'’  ‘You have been very kind,’ said he: ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4743,'’  ‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4744,'‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,’ said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4745,'‘I could not bear the disgrace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4746,'I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4747,'’  I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4748,'‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried; on which he bowed and left the room without another word.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4749,'When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4750,'Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I thought it well to perform myself that night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4751,'As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4752,'‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’  ‘Certainly not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4753,'’  ‘She came in just now by the back door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4754,'I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see some one; but I think that it is hardly safe, and should be stopped.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4755,'‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4756,'Are you sure that everything is fastened?’  ‘Quite sure, dad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4757,'’  ‘Then, good-night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4758,'’ I kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4759,'I am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4760,'Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4761,'On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4762,'I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4763,'I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4764,'About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4765,'It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4766,'I lay listening with all my ears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4767,'Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4768,'I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4769,'‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?’  The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4770,'He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4771,'At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and turned as pale as death.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4772,'I snatched it up and examined it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4773,'One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4776,'‘Yes, you thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4777,'‘There are none missing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4778,'There cannot be any missing,’ said he.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4782,'I shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4783,'I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4787,'‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4788,'’  By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4790,'I sent the house-maid for the police, and put the investigation into their hands at once.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4791,'When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4792,'I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4793,'I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4794,'‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4795,'It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4797,'And then realizing the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4798,'He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4799,'‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4800,'If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4801,'’  ‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me, with a sneer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4802,'I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4803,'There was but one way for it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4804,'I called in the inspector, and gave him into custody.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4805,'A search was made at once, not only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4806,'This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4813,'Do you receive much company? he asked.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4815,'Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4816,'No one else, I think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4817,'Do you go out much in society?  Arthur does.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4818,'Mary and I stay at home.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4819,'We neither of us care for it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4820,'That is unusual in a young girl.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4823,'She is four-and-twenty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4824,'This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4825,'Terrible! She is even more affected than I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4826,'You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?  How can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4827,'I hardly consider that a conclusive proof.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4828,'Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?  Yes, it was twisted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4829,'Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?  God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4830,'But it is too heavy a task.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4831,'What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?  Precisely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4832,'And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4833,'There are several singular points about the case.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4834,'What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?  They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4835,'A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4836,'What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?  They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4837,'Have they thought of looking outside the house?  Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4838,'The whole garden has already been minutely examined.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4839,'Now, my dear sir, said Holmes, is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4840,'Consider what is involved by your theory.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4841,'You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4842,'I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?  But what other is there? cried the banker, with a gesture of despair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4843,'If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?  It is our task to find that out, replied Holmes; so now, if you please, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4844,'Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4845,'My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4846,'I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’s judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4847,'He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4848,'Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4849,'A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4850,'Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4851,'A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4852,'On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4853,'On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4854,'Holmes left us standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4855,'So long was he that Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4856,'Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4857,'We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4858,'She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4859,'I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4860,'Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4861,'As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4862,'Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4863,'You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad? she asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4864,'No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4865,'But I am so sure that he is innocent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4866,'You know what women’s instincts are.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4867,'I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4868,'Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?  Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4869,'How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?  Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4870,'Oh do, do take my word for it that he is innocent.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4871,'Let the matter drop and say no more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4872,'It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!  I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4873,'Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4874,'This gentleman? she asked, facing round to me.  No, his friend.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4875,'He wished us to leave him alone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4876,'He is round in the stable lane now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4877,'The stable lane? She raised her dark eyebrows.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4878,'What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4879,'I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4880,'I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it, returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4881,'I believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4882,'Might I ask you a question or two?  Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4883,'You heard nothing yourself last night?  Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4884,'I heard that, and I came down.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4885,'You shut up the windows and doors the night before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4886,'Did you fasten all the windows?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4887,'Were they all fastened this morning?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4888,'You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?  Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.  I see.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4889,'You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4890,'But what is the good of all these vague theories, cried the banker, impatiently, when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?  Wait a little, Mr. Holder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4891,'We must come back to that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4892,'About this girl, Miss Holder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4893,'You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?  Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4894,'I saw the man, too, in the gloom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4895,'Do you know him?  Oh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4896,'His name is Francis Prosper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4897,'He stood, said Holmes, to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?  Yes, he did.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4898,'And he is a man with a wooden leg?  Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4899,'Why, you are like a magician, said she.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4900,'How do you know that? She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’s thin, eager face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4901,'I should be very glad now to go up-stairs, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4902,'I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4903,'Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4904,'He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4905,'This he opened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4906,'Now we shall go up-stairs, said he, at last.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4907,'The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4908,'Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4909,'Which key was used to open it? he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4910,'That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4911,'Have you it here?  That is it on the dressing-table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4912,'Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4913,'It is a noiseless lock, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4914,'It is no wonder that it did not wake you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4915,'This case, I presume, contains the coronet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4916,'We must have a look at it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4917,'He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4918,'It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4919,'At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.  Now, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4920,'Holder, said Holmes, here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4921,'Might I beg that you will break it off.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4922,'The banker recoiled in horror.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4923,'I should not dream of trying, said he.  Then I will.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4924,'Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4925,'I feel it give a little, said he; but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4926,'An ordinary man could not do it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4927,'Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4928,'Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4929,'Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?  I do not know what to think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4930,'It is all dark to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4931,'But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4932,'What do you think, Miss Holder?  I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4933,'Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?  He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.  Thank you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4934,'We have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4935,'With your permission, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4936,'Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4937,'He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4938,'For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4939,'I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4940,'Holder, said he; I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.  But the gems, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4941,'Where are they?  I cannot tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4942,'The banker wrung his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4943,'I shall never see them again! he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4944,'And my son? You give me hopes?  My opinion is in no way altered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4945,'Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?  If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4946,'I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4947,'I would give my fortune to have them back.  Very good.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4948,'I shall look into the matter between this and then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4949,'Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4950,'It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4951,'Several times during our homeward journey I endeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4952,'It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4953,'He hurried to his chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4954,'With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4955,'I think that this should do, said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4956,'I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4957,'I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-of-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4958,'I hope that I may be back in a few hours.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4959,'He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off upon his expedition.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4960,'I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4961,'He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4962,'I only looked in as I passed, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4963,'I am going right on.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4964,'Where to?  Oh, to the other side of the West End.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4965,'It may be some time before I get back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4966,'Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4967,'How are you getting on?  Oh, so so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4968,'Nothing to complain of.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4969,'I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4970,'It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4971,'However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4972,'I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4973,'His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of color upon his sallow cheeks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4974,'He hastened up-stairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4975,'I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4976,'It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4977,'I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4978,'You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson, said he; but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4979,'Why, it is after nine now, I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4980,'I should not be surprised if that were he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4981,'I thought I heard a ring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4982,'It was, indeed, our friend the financier.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4983,'I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4984,'He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4985,'I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4986,'Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4987,'Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4988,'One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4989,'My niece, Mary, has deserted me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4990,'Deserted you?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4991,'Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4992,'I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4993,'Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4994,'It is to that remark that she refers in this note:    ‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble   upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible   misfortune might never have occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4995,'I cannot, with this   thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and   I feel that I must leave you for ever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4996,'Do not worry about my   future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search   for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to   me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4997,'In life or in death, I am ever your loving       MARY.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4998,'’  What could she mean by that note, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(4999,'Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?  No, no, nothing of the kind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5000,'It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5001,'Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5002,'Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5003,'Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?  You would not think £1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?  I would pay ten.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5004,'That would be unnecessary.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5005,'Three thousand will cover the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5006,'And there is a little reward, I fancy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5007,'Have you your check-book? Here is a pen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5008,'Better make it out for £4000 pounds.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5009,'With a dazed face the banker made out the required check.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5010,'Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5011,'With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5012,'You have it! he gasped.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5013,'I am saved! I am saved!  The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5014,'There is one other thing you owe, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5015,'Holder, said Sherlock Holmes, rather sternly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5016,'Owe! He caught up a pen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5017,'Name the sum, and I will pay it.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5020,'Then it was not Arthur who took them?  I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5021,'You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know that the truth is known.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5022,'He knows it already.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5023,'When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5024,'Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5025,'For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!  I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5026,'And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5027,'They have now fled together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5028,'My Mary? Impossible!  It is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5029,'Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5030,'He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5031,'Your niece knew nothing of such men.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5032,'When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5033,'The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5034,'I cannot, and I will not, believe it! cried the banker, with an ashen face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5035,'I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5036,'Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5037,'His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5038,'She told him of the coronet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5039,'His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5040,'I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5041,'She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming down-stairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5042,'Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5043,'In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your dressing-room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5044,'Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5045,'Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5046,'She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5047,'He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5048,'As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5049,'But the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5050,'He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5051,'Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5052,'In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5053,'Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and was endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5054,'Is it possible? gasped the banker.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5055,'You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5056,'He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5057,'He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5058,'And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet, cried Mr. Holder.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5059,'Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5060,'How cruelly I have misjudged him!  When I arrived at the house, continued Holmes, I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5061,'I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5062,'I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5063,'Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5064,'I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5065,'I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5066,'I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5067,'There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5068,'I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5069,'The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5070,'I followed them up, and found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5071,'Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5072,'I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5073,'Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5074,'When he came to the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clew.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5075,'On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that some one had passed out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5076,'I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5077,'I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5078,'A man had waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled with him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5079,'He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5080,'The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?  It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5081,'Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5082,'But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5083,'As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5084,'When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5085,'And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5086,'But among them was Sir George Burnwell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5087,'I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5088,'It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5089,'Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5090,'Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5091,'I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5092,'With these I journeyed down to Streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5093,'[Illustration: I CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD]  I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening, said Mr. Holder.  Precisely. It was I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5094,'I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5095,'It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5096,'At first, of course, he denied everything.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5097,'But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5098,'I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5099,'Then he became a little more reasonable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5100,'I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£1000 apiece.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5101,'That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5102,'‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5103,'Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £1000 apiece.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5104,'Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5105,'A day which has saved England from a great public scandal, said the banker, rising.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5106,'Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5107,'Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5108,'And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5109,'As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5110,'Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5111,'I think that we may safely say, returned Holmes, that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5112,'It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5113,'Adventure XII  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES   To the man who loves art for its own sake, remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5114,'It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5115,'And yet, said I, smiling, I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5116,'You have erred, perhaps, he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a meditative mood—you have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5117,'It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter, I remarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5118,'No, it is not selfishness or conceit, said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5119,'If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5120,'Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5121,'You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5122,'It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5123,'A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5124,'Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5125,'Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5126,'At the same time, he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5127,'The small matter in which I endeavored to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5128,'But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5129,'The end may have been so, I answered, but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5130,'Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5131,'Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5132,'As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5133,'I think that I have touched bottom at last, however.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5134,'This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5135,'Read it! He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5136,'It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:    DEAR MR.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5137,'HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as   to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has   been offered to me as governess.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5138,'I shall call at half-past ten   to-morrow, if I do not inconvenience you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5139,'Yours faithfully,     VIOLET HUNTER.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5140,'Do you know the young lady? I asked.  Not I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5141,'It is half-past ten now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5142,'Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5143,'It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5144,'You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5145,'It may be so in this case, also.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5146,'Well, let us hope so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5147,'But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5148,'As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5149,'She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5150,'You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure, said she, as my companion rose to greet her; but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5151,'Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5152,'I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5153,'I could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5154,'He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips together, to listen to her story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5155,'I have been a governess for five years, said she, in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5156,'I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5157,'At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wits’ end as to what I should do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5158,'There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5159,'Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5160,'She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5161,'Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5162,'A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5163,'As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to Miss Stoper:  ‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5164,'Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5165,'He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5166,'‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.  ‘Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5167,'’  ‘As governess?’  ‘Yes, sir.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5169,'’  ‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5170,'‘How could any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’  ‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5171,'‘A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’  ‘Tut, tut!’ he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5172,'‘This is all quite beside the question.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5173,'The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5174,'If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5175,'But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £100 a year.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5176,'’  You may imagine, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5177,'Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5178,'The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5179,'‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5180,'’  It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5181,'As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5182,'‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.  ‘Hampshire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5183,'Charming rural place.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5184,'The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5185,'It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5187,'’  ‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5188,'Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5189,'I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5190,'‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’  ‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5191,'‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5192,'You see no difficulty, heh?’  ‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’  ‘Quite so.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5193,'In dress now, for example.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5194,'We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5195,'If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5196,'Heh?’  ‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5198,'’  ‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’  I could hardly believe my ears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5199,'As you may observe, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5200,'Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5201,'It has been considered artistic.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5202,'I could not dream of sacrificing it in this off-hand fashion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5203,'‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5204,'He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5205,'‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5206,'‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5207,'And so you won’t cut your hair?’  ‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered, firmly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5208,'‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5209,'It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5210,'In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5211,'’  The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.');

INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5218,'Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5219,'After all, if these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5220,'Very few governesses in England are getting £100 a year.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5221,'Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5222,'Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5223,'I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I received this letter from the gentleman himself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5224,'I have it here, and I will read it to you:      ‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5225,'‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your     address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have     reconsidered your decision.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5226,'My wife is very anxious that you     should come, for she has been much attracted by my description     of you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5227,'We are willing to give £30 a quarter, or £120 a year, so     as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads     may cause you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5228,'They are not very exacting, after all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5229,'My wife     is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like     you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5230,'You need not,     however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one     belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which     would, I should think, fit you very well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5231,'Then, as to sitting     here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that     need cause you no inconvenience.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5232,'As regards your hair, it is     no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its     beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must     remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased     salary may recompense you for the loss.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5233,'Your duties, as far as     the child is concerned, are very light.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5234,'Now do try to come, and     I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5235,'Let me know     your train.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5236,'Yours faithfully,      JEPHRO RUCASTLE.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5237,'’  That is the letter which I have just received, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5238,'Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5239,'I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5240,'Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question, said Holmes, smiling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5241,'But you would not advise me to refuse?  I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5242,'What is the meaning of it all, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5243,'Holmes?  Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5244,'Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?  Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5245,'Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5246,'Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5247,'That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5248,'But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5249,'But the money, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5250,'Holmes, the money!  Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5251,'That is what makes me uneasy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5252,'Why should they give you £120 a year, when they could have their pick for £40? There must be some strong reason behind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5253,'I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5254,'I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5255,'Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5256,'I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5257,'There is something distinctly novel about some of the features.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5258,'If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—  Danger! What danger do you foresee?  Holmes shook his head gravely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5259,'It would cease to be a danger if we could define it, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5260,'But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.  That is enough.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5261,'She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5262,'I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5263,'Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5264,'With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5265,'At least, said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the stairs, she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5266,'And she would need to be, said Holmes, gravely; I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5267,'It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5268,'A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5269,'The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5270,'As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5271,'Data! data! data! he cried, impatiently.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5272,'I can’t make bricks without clay.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5273,'And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5274,'The telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as I was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night, and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5275,'He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5276,'Just look up the trains in Bradshaw, said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5277,'The summons was a brief and urgent one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5278,'Please be at the ‘Black Swan’ Hotel at Winchester at   mid-day to-morrow, it said.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5279,'Do come! I am at my wits’   end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5280,'HUNTER.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5281,'Will you come with me? asked Holmes, glancing up.  I should wish to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5282,'Just look it up, then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5283,'There is a train at half-past nine, said I, glancing over my Bradshaw.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5284,'It is due at Winchester at 11.30.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5285,'That will do very nicely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5286,'Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5287,'*       *       *       *       *  By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5288,'Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down, and began to admire the scenery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5289,'It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5290,'The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5291,'All over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5292,'Are they not fresh and beautiful? I cried, with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5293,'But Holmes shook his head gravely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5294,'Do you know, Watson, said he, that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5295,'You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5296,'I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5297,'Good heavens! I cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5298,'Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?  They always fill me with a certain horror.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5299,'It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful country-side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5300,'You horrify me!  But the reason is very obvious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5301,'The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5302,'There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5303,'But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5304,'Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5305,'Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5306,'It is the five miles of country which makes the danger.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5307,'Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.  No.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5308,'If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.  Quite so. She has her freedom.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5309,'What _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?  I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5310,'But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5311,'Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5312,'The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5313,'She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5314,'I am so delighted that you have come, she said, earnestly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5315,'It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5316,'Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5317,'Pray tell us what has happened to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5318,'I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5319,'Rucastle to be back before three.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5320,'I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5321,'Let us have everything in its due order.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5322,'Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5323,'In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5324,'It is only fair to them to say that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5325,'But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5326,'What can you not understand?  Their reasons for their conduct.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5327,'But you shall have it all just as it occurred.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5328,'When I came down, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5329,'Rucastle met me here, and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5330,'It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5331,'There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high-road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5332,'This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5333,'A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5334,'[Illustration: ‘I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME’]  I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5335,'There was no truth, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5336,'Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5337,'I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5338,'From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5339,'Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5340,'As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.  Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5341,'Rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in feature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5342,'She impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5343,'It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5344,'Her light gray eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5345,'He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5346,'And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5347,'She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5348,'More than once I have surprised her in tears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5349,'I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5350,'He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5351,'His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5352,'Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5353,'But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5354,'Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5355,'I am glad of all details, remarked my friend, whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5356,'I shall try not to miss anything of importance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5357,'The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5358,'There are only two, a man and his wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5359,'Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5360,'Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5361,'Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5362,'His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5363,'Rucastle, and much less amiable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5364,'They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5365,'For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5366,'Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5367,'‘Oh yes,’ said he, turning to me; ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5368,'I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5369,'We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5370,'You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5371,'’  The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5372,'It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5373,'It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5374,'Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5375,'They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5376,'A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5377,'In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5378,'Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5379,'You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5380,'Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5381,'After an hour or so, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5382,'Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5383,'Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5384,'Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5385,'Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5386,'I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5387,'You can easily imagine, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5388,'Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5389,'They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5390,'At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5391,'My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5392,'On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5393,'I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5394,'At least that was my first impression.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5395,'At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5396,'The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5397,'This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5398,'I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5399,'Rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5400,'She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5401,'‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5402,'’  ‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5403,'‘No; I know no one in these parts.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5404,'’  ‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5405,'’  ‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5406,'’  ‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5407,'Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5408,'’  I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5409,'Rucastle drew down the blind.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5410,'That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5411,'Pray continue, said Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5412,'Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5413,'You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5414,'On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5415,'Rucastle took me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5416,'As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5417,'‘Look in here!’ said Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5418,'Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5419,'‘Is he not a beauty?’  I looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5420,'‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5421,'‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5422,'I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5423,'We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5424,'Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5425,'For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it is as much as your life is worth.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5426,'’  The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5427,'It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5428,'I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5429,'As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5430,'It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5431,'It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5432,'That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5433,'And now I have a very strange experience to tell you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5434,'I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5435,'One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5436,'There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5437,'I had filled the first two with my linen, and, as I had still much to pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5438,'It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5439,'The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5440,'There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5441,'It was my coil of hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5442,'I took it up and examined it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5443,'It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5444,'But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5445,'How _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5446,'I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5447,'Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5448,'I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5449,'I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5450,'Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5451,'There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5452,'A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5453,'One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5454,'Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5455,'His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5456,'He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5457,'This aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5458,'There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5459,'They were evidently all deserted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5460,'As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5461,'Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5462,'‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5463,'I was preoccupied with business matters.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5464,'’  I assured him that I was not offended.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5465,'‘By-the-way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5466,'’  He looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5467,'‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5468,'‘I have made my dark room up there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5469,'But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5470,'Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5471,'I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.  Well, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5472,'Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5473,'It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5474,'It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5475,'They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5476,'At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5477,'It was only yesterday that the chance came.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5478,'I may tell you that, besides Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5479,'Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5480,'Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when I came up-stairs, there was the key in the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5481,'I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5482,'Rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5483,'I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5484,'There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5485,'Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5486,'They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5487,'The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5488,'The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5489,'This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5490,'Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5491,'As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5492,'A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5493,'My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5494,'I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5495,'Rucastle, who was waiting outside.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5496,'‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5497,'I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5498,'’  ‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5499,'‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’  But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5500,'I was keenly on my guard against him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5501,'‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5502,'‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5503,'Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’  ‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5504,'‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5505,'‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’  ‘I am sure that I do not know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5506,'’  ‘It is to keep people out who have no business there.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5507,'Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5508,'‘I am sure if I had known—’  ‘Well, then, you know now.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5509,'And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again—’ here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5510,'’  I was so terrified that I do not know what I did.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5511,'I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5512,'I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5513,'Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5514,'I could not live there longer without some advice.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5515,'I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5516,'They were all horrible to me.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5517,'If I could only bring you down all would be well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5518,'Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5519,'My mind was soon made up.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5520,'I would send you a wire.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5521,'I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5522,'A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5523,'I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5524,'I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5525,'Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5526,'Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5527,'Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5528,'Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5529,'My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5530,'Is Toller still drunk? he asked.  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5531,'I heard his wife tell Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5532,'Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.  That is well.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5533,'And the Rucastles go out to-night?  Yes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5534,'Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?  Yes, the wine-cellar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5535,'You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5536,'Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.  I will try.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5537,'What is it?  We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5538,'The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5539,'There only remains Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5540,'Toller, who might give the alarm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5541,'If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.  I will do it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5542,'Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5543,'Of course there is only one feasible explanation.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5544,'You have been brought there to personate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5545,'As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5546,'You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the color of your hair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5547,'Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5548,'By a curious chance you came upon her tresses.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5549,'The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5550,'The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate with her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5551,'So much is fairly clear.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5552,'The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5553,'What on earth has that to do with it? I ejaculated.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5554,'My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5555,'Don’t you see that the converse is equally valid.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5556,'I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5557,'This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5558,'I am sure that you are right, Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5559,'Holmes, cried our client.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5560,'A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5561,'Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5562,'We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5563,'We can do nothing until seven o’clock.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5564,'At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5565,'We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5566,'The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5567,'Have you managed it? asked Holmes.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5568,'A loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. That is Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5569,'Toller in the cellar, said she.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5570,'Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5571,'Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5572,'You have done well indeed! cried Holmes, with enthusiasm.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5573,'Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5574,'We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5575,'Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5576,'Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5577,'No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes’s face clouded over.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5578,'I trust that we are not too late, said he.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5579,'I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5580,'Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5581,'It was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united strength.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5582,'Together we rushed into the room. It was empty.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5583,'There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5584,'The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5585,'There has been some villainy here, said Holmes; this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions, and has carried his victim off.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5586,'But how?  Through the skylight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5587,'We shall soon see how he managed it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5588,'He swung himself up onto the roof.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5589,'Ah, yes, he cried; here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5590,'That is how he did it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5591,'But it is impossible, said Miss Hunter; the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5592,'He has come back and done it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5593,'I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5594,'I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5595,'I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5596,'The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5597,'Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5598,'You villain! said he, where’s your daughter?  The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5599,'It is for me to ask you that, he shrieked, you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5600,'I’ll serve you! He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5601,'He’s gone for the dog! cried Miss Hunter.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5602,'I have my revolver, said I.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5603,'Better close the front door, cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5604,'We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5605,'An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.  My God! he cried.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5606,'Some one has loosed the dog.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5607,'It’s not been fed for two days.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5608,'Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!  Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5609,'There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5610,'Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5611,'With much labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5612,'We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and, having despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5613,'We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.  Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5614,'Toller! cried Miss Hunter.  Yes, miss. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5615,'Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5616,'Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5617,'Ha! said Holmes, looking keenly at her.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5618,'It is clear that Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5619,'Toller knows more about this matter than any one else.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5620,'Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5621,'Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5622,'I will soon make it clear to you, said she; and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5623,'If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5624,'She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5625,'She was slighted like, and had no say in anything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5626,'Fowler at a friend’s house.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5627,'As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5628,'He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5629,'He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5630,'When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5631,'Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5632,'Ah, said Holmes, I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5633,'Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?  Yes, sir.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5634,'And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.  That was it, sir.  But Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5635,'Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.  Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5636,'Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman, said Mrs. Toller, serenely.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5637,'And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5638,'You have it, sir, just as it happened.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5639,'I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5640,'Toller, said Holmes, for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5641,'And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5642,'Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5643,'And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5644,'Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5645,'They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5646,'Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a Government appointment in the Island of Mauritius.');
INSERT INTO sentences VALUES(5647,'As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.');
