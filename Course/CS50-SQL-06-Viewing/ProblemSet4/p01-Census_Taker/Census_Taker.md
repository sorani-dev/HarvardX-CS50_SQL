## Problem to Solve

You are a census taker working for the Nepali government. As you crest one final hill, your breath catches at the sight of a Himalayan sunrise, casting a glow on the village you’ve journeyed so far to reach. Your guide, a local, halts abruptly. Underneath the steady rustle of your census papers, you feel an itch of curiosity. After all, it’s not every day your job takes you to a village like this one.

In `census.db`, process your data into views the Nepali government can use for record-keeping.

## Demo

## Distribution Code

For this problem, you’ll need to download `census.db`, along with a few `.sql` files in which you’ll write your queries.

### Download the distribution code

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

```bash
$
```

Next execute

```bash
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/sql/2023/x/psets/4/census.zip
```

in order to download a ZIP called `census.zip` into your codespace.

Then execute

```bash
unzip census.zip
```

to create a folder called census. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

```bash
rm census.zip
```

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

```bash
cd census
```

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

```bash
census/ $
```

If all was successful, you should execute

```bash
ls
```

and see a database named `census.db` alongside several `.sql` files. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

## Schema

In `census.db` you’ll find a single table, `census`. In the `census` table, you’ll find the following columns:

- `id`, which uniquely identifies each census record
- `district`, which is the name of the census record’s district
- `locality`, which is the name of the census record’s locality within the district
- `families`, which is the number of families associated with the census record
- `households`, which is the total number of households associated with the census record (multiple families may live in the same household)
- `population`, which is the population associated with the census record
- `male`, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as male
- `female`, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as female

## Specification

In each of the corresponding `.sql` files, write a SQL statement to create each of the following views of the data in `census.db`. Note that, while views can be created from other views, each of your views should stand alone (i.e., not rely on a prior view).

### **Rural**

In `rural.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named rural. This view should contain all census records relating to a rural municipality (identified by including “rural” in their name). Ensure the view contains all of the columns from the census table.

### **Total**

In `total.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `total`. This view should contain the sums for each numeric column in `census`, across all districts and localities. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `families`, which is the sum of families from every locality in Nepal.
- `households`, which is the sum of households from every locality in Nepal.
- `population`, which is the sum of the population from every locality in Nepal.
- `male`, which is the sum of people identifying as male from every locality in Nepal.
- `female`, which is the sum of people identifying as female from every locality in Nepal.

### **By District**

In `by_district.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `by_district`. This view should contain the sums for each numeric column in `census`, grouped by `district`. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `district`, which is the name of the district.
- `families`, which is the total number of families in the district.
- `households`, which is the total number of households in the district.
- `population`, which is the total population of the district.
- `male`, which is the total number of people identifying as male in the district.
- `female`, which is the total number of people identifying as female in the district.

### **Most Populated**

In `most_populated.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `most_populated`. This view should contain, in order from greatest to least, the most populated *districts* in Nepal. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `district`, which is the name of the district.
- `families`, which is the total number of families in the district.
- `households`, which is the total number of households in the district.
- `population`, which is the total population of the district.
- `male`, which is the total number of people identifying as male in the district.
- `female`, which is the total number of people identifying as female in the district.

## Usage

To test your views as you write them in your `.sql` files, you can run a query on the database by running

```bash
.read FILENAME
```

where `FILENAME` is the name of the file containing your SQL query. For example,

```bash
.read rural.sql
```

Keep in mind you can also use

```sql
DROP VIEW name;
```

where name is the name of your view, to remove a view before creating it anew.

## How to Test

While `check50The Private Eye` is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to also test your views on your own.

### Correctness
