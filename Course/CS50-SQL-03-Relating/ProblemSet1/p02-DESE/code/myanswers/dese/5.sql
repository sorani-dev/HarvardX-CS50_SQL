-- DESE would like you to determine in what cities 
-- additional public schools might be needed. 
-- In 5.sql, write a SQL query to find cities with 3 or fewer 
-- public schools. Your query should return the names of the cities 
-- and the number of public schools within them, 
-- ordered from greatest number of public schools to least. 
-- If two cities have the same number of public schools, 
-- order them alphabetically.
SELECT city,
    COUNT("type") AS "Number of public schools"
FROM schools
WHERE "type" = "Public School"
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT("type") <= 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC,
