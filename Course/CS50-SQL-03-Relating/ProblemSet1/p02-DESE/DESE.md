Problem to Solve

You just landed a new job as a data analyst for the State of Massachusetts, working within the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (or DESE, for short!). DESE oversees the state’s public education system. One responsibility of DESE is to ensure every child has a quality education—one in which they encounter experienced teachers, have access to an abundance of resources, and ultimately graduate having met all requirements of the state. Your SQL skills have a part to play in these lofty goals!

In a database called dese.db, answer questions about the state of education in Massachusetts.
Demo
Distribution Code

For this problem, you’ll need to download dese.db, along with several .sql files in which you’ll write your queries.
Download the distribution code

Log into cs50.dev, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

$

Next execute

wget https://cdn.cs50.net/sql/2023/x/psets/1/dese.zip

in order to download a ZIP called dese.zip into your codespace.

Then execute

unzip dese.zip

to create a folder called dese. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

rm dese.zip

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

cd dese

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

dese/ $

If all was successful, you should execute

ls

and see a database named dese.db alongside several .sql files. Executing sqlite3 dese.db should open the database in sqlite3, via which you’ll execute SQL queries. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!
Schema

In Massachusetts, public education is delegated to districts, a type of school government often associated with an individual town. These districts, in turn, contain many individual schools. Consider the entity relationship diagram below, which codifies the relationship between districts, schools, and other data DESE collects.

reports

Within dese.db, you’ll find several tables that implement the relationships described in the diagram above. Click the drop-downs below to learn more about the schema of each individual table.
districts table

The districts table contains the following columns:

    id, which is the ID of the district
    name, which is the name of the district
    type, which denotes the type of district. In Massachusetts, there are public school districts (denoted “Public School District”) and charter districts (denoted “Charter District”). No need to learn the difference, though you can do so from Wikipedia if curious!
    city, which is the city in which the district is located
    state, which is the state in which the district is located
    zip, which is the ZIP Code in which the district is located

schools table

The schools table contains the following columns:

    id, which is the ID of the school
    district_id, which is the ID of the district to which the school belongs
    name, which is the name of the school
    type, which denotes the type of school. In Massachusetts, there are public schools (denoted “Public School”) and charter schools (denoted “Charter School”). No need to learn the difference, though you can do so from Wikipedia if curious!
    city, which is the city in which the school is located
    state, which is the state in which the school is located
    zip, which is the ZIP Code in which the school is located

graduation_rates table

The graduation_rates table contains the following columns:

    id, which is the ID of the graduation rate
    school_id, which is the ID of the school with which the graduation is associated
    graduated, which is the percentage of students, 0–100, who graduated on time
    dropped, which is the percentage of students, 0–100, who dropped out of school before graduation
    excluded, which is the percentage of students, 0–100, who were “excluded” (i.e., expelled)

expenditures table

The expenditures table contains the following columns:

    id, which is the ID of the expenditure
    district_id, which is the ID of the district with which the expenditure is associated
    pupils, which is the number of pupils attending the given district
    per_pupil_expenditure, which is the amount of money spent, in dollars, on each student attending the district

staff_evaluations table

The staff_evaluations table contains the following columns:

    id, which is the ID of the evaluation report
    district_id, which is the ID of the district with which the evaluation is associated
    evaluated, which is the percentage of district staff, 0–100, formally evaluated
    exemplary, which is the percentage of district staff, 0–100, evaluated as “exemplary”
    proficient, which is the percentage of district staff, 0–100, evaluated as “proficient”
    needs_improvement, which is the percentage of district staff, 0–100, evaluated as “needing improvement”
    unsatisfactory, which is the percentage of district staff, 0–100, evaluated as “unsatisfactory”

You might (cleverly!) note that some of these relationships could be implemented with a single table. You’d be correct, though in this case, you’ll simply have to work with what your colleagues at DESE created!
Specification

For each of the following questions, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular rows: your queries should be accurate even if the ids were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question.
1.sql

Your colleague is preparing a map of all public schools in Massachusetts. In 1.sql, write a SQL query to find the names and cities of all public schools in Massachusetts.

    Keep in mind that not all schools in the schools table are considered traditional public schools. Massachusetts also recognizes charter schools, which (according to DESE!) are considered distinct.

2.sql

Your team is working on archiving old data. In 2.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of districts that are no longer operational.

    Districts that are no longer operational have “(non-op)” at the end of their name.

3.sql

The Massachusetts Legislature would like to learn how much money, on average, districts spent per-pupil last year. In 3.sql, write a SQL query to find the average per-pupil expenditure. Name the column “Average District Per-Pupil Expenditure”.

    Note the per_pupil_expenditure column in the expenditures table contains the average amount, per pupil, each district spent last year. You’ve been asked to find the average of this set of averages, weighting all districts equally regardless of their size.

4.sql

Some cities have more public schools than others. In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 10 cities with the most public schools. Your query should return the names of the cities and the number of public schools within them, ordered from greatest number of public schools to least. If two cities have the same number of public schools, order them alphabetically.
5.sql

DESE would like you to determine in what cities additional public schools might be needed. In 5.sql, write a SQL query to find cities with 3 or fewer public schools. Your query should return the names of the cities and the number of public schools within them, ordered from greatest number of public schools to least. If two cities have the same number of public schools, order them alphabetically.
6.sql

DESE wants to assess which schools achieved a 100% graduation rate. In 6.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) that reported a 100% graduation rate.
7.sql

DESE is preparing a report on schools in the city of Cambridge. In 7.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) in the Cambridge school district.
8.sql

A parent wants to send their child to a district with many other students. In 8.sql, write a SQL query to display the names of all school districts and the number of pupils enrolled in each.
9.sql

Another parent wants to send their child to a district with few other students. In 9.sql, write a SQL query to find the name (or names) of the school district(s) with the single least number of pupils. Report only the name(s).
10.sql

In Massachusetts, school district expenditures are in part determined by local taxes on property (e.g., home) values. In 10.sql, write a SQL query to find the 10 public school districts with the highest per-pupil expenditures. Your query should return the names of the districts and the per-pupil expenditure for each.
11.sql

Is there a relationship between school expenditures and graduation rates? In 11.sql, write a SQL query to display the names of schools, their per-pupil expenditure, and their graduation rate. Sort the schools from greatest per-pupil expenditure to least. If two schools have the same per-pupil expenditure, sort by school name.

    You should assume a school spends the same amount per-pupil their district as a whole spends.

12.sql

A parent asks you for advice on finding the best public school districts in Massachusetts. In 12.sql, write a SQL query to find public school districts with above-average per-pupil expenditures and an above-average percentage of teachers rated “exemplary”. Your query should return the districts’ names, along with their per-pupil expenditures and percentage of teachers rated exemplary. Sort the results first by the percentage of teachers rated exemplary (high to low), then by the per-pupil expenditure (high to low).
Hint
13.sql

In 13.sql, write a SQL query to answer a question you have about the data! The query should:

    Involve at least one JOIN or subquery

Usage

To test your queries as you write them in your .sql files, you can query the database by running

.read FILENAME

where FILENAME is the name of the file containing your SQL query. For example,

.read 1.sql

You can also run

$ cat FILENAME | sqlite3 dese.db > output.txt

to redirect the output of the query to a text file called output.txt. (This can be useful for checking how many rows are returned by your query!)
How to Test

While check50 is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to instead test your code on your own for each of the following. If you’re using the dese.db database provided in this problem’s distribution, you should find that…

    Executing 1.sql results in a table with 2 columns and 1,761 rows.
    Executing 2.sql results in a table with 1 column and 121 rows.
    Executing 3.sql results in a table with 1 column and 1 row.
    Executing 4.sql results in a table with 2 columns and 10 rows.
    Executing 5.sql results in a table with 2 columns and 201 rows.
    Executing 6.sql results in a table with 1 column and 9 rows.
    Executing 7.sql results in a table with 1 column and 17 rows.
    Executing 8.sql results in a table with 2 columns and 396 rows.
    Executing 9.sql results in a table with 1 column and 1 row.
    Executing 10.sql results in a table with 2 columns and 10 rows.
    Executing 11.sql results in a table with 3 columns and 391 rows.
    Executing 12.sql results in a table with 3 columns and 65 rows.

13.sql is up to you!

Note that row counts do not include header rows that only show column names.
