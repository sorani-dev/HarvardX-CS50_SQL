-- You need to make a recommendation about which players the team should consider hiring. 
-- With the team’s dwindling budget, the general manager wants to know which players 
-- were paid the lowest salaries in 2001. In 4.sql, 
-- write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.
--     Sort players by salary, lowest to highest.
--     If two players have the same salary, sort alphabetically by first name and then by last name.
--     If two players have the same first and last name, sort by player ID.
--     Your query should return three columns, one for players’ first names, 
--         one for their last names, and one for their salaries.
