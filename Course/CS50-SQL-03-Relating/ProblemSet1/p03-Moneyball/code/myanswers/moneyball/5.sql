-- Itâ€™s a bit of a slow day in the office. Though Satchel no longer plays, 
-- in 5.sql, write a SQL query to find all teams that Satchel Paige played for.
--     Your query should return a table with a single column, one for the name of the teams.

    INNER JOIN performances ON performances.team_id = teams.id
