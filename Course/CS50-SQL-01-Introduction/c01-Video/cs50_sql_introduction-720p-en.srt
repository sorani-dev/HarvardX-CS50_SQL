00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,850
DAVID J. MALAN: Hello, world.

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,130
This is CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL, or Sequel.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,460
My name is David Malan.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,210
CARTER ZENKE: And my name is Carter Zenke.

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,040
DAVID J. MALAN: CS50 itself is an introduction to computer science.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,560
And along the way you learn about SQL and more.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
This course dives all the more deeply into SQL specifically.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,070
And you can take it before, during, or after CS50 itself,

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,060
whether you're a computer scientist, data scientist, programmer, or simply

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,130
someone who's interested in databases.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,922
CARTER ZENKE: Now we'll begin with software

12
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:48,350
called SQLite, which you can use to query a table of data,

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,510
maybe a table of books, for instance.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,410
You will then graduate and work not just with one table but multiple,

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,650
and see how to define relationships among them.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,290
Afterwards you'll figure out how to design your very

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,819
own database from scratch, learning about schemas and data types.

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,120
And then you'll see how to add data to that database,

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,350
how to insert, update, and delete some data altogether.

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,200
Soon after you'll see how to write alternate views

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,430
for your data, new ways of simplifying your data for yourself and for others.

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,530
And then, towards the end of the course, you

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,520
will see how to optimize your queries, how to reduce the time that they take,

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,410
although at the cost of some space.

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,070
And then finally, to cap it all off, you'll

26
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,980
learn other DBMSs, Database Management Systems, like MySQL and Postgres,

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,120
that you can use to do all of this and more at a much bigger scale.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,930
Now this is CS50.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,000
