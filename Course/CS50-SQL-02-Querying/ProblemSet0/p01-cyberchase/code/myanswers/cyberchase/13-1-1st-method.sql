-- Write a SQL query to find the titles of episodes that have aired during the holiday season, usually in December in the United States.

--     Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each episode.
--     Try to find a better solution than LIKE if you can!

SELECT title
FROM episodes
WHERE air_date LIKE '____-12-__';
